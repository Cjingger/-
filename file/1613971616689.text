AB A concern about students' conceptual difficulties in organic chemistry prompted this study. It was found that prior knowledge from general chemistry was critical in organic chemistry, but what were some of the concepts that comprised that prior knowledge? Therefore an analysis of four years of organic chemistry quiz data was undertaken. Multiple general chemistry concepts were revealed that are essential prior knowledge in organic chemistry. The general chemistry concepts that were found pose a challenge to organic chemistry instructors who have identified those same concepts as ones they review or consider important in organic chemistry. A review of the literature provides recommendations that address the general chemistry students' difficulties revealed in this study. Further research, however, is needed to follow through on those recommendations.

AB This paper examines the current state of the implementation of green chemistry into organic chemistry textbooks. Content analysis of the 15 most used organic chemistry textbooks revealed that only 10 of them had any mention of green chemistry. In textbooks that contained mentions of green chemistry, it was mentioned on less than 1% of pages. Green chemistry topics mentioned include the 12 green chemistry principles, atom economy, greener solvents and reagents, recycling, biodegradable materials, renewable feedstocks, and catalysis. Only three textbooks contained several end-of-chapter problems with green chemistry content, and all but two included the majority of green chemistry content in extraneous textboxes. The current presentation of green chemistry concepts and lack of assessment items is more suitable for a lecture-based approach as opposed to creating a student-centered learning environment.

AB The American Chemical Society (ACS), Division of Chemical Education, Examinations Institute, has been developing content maps to describe comprehensively the undergraduate curriculum aligned to traditional subdisciplines. These content maps have been developed through the combined efforts of many faculty members who teach the targeted courses in the subdiscipline. A recent collaboration between the Examinations Institute and the ACS Green Chemistry Institute has resulted in the consideration of green chemistry content in the context of the content maps. The inclusion of green chemistry concepts in the context of organic chemistry has been the initial focus of the work of this collaboration. Through working with faculty who teach green chemistry courses or organic chemistry courses with the theme of green chemistry, the organic chemistry content map has been revised and reconceptualized with the theme of green chemistry included. The process, excerpts of the content map, and alignments of traditional organic chemistry exam items to both the organic chemistry content map and the organic chemistry content map with the inclusion of green chemistry are reported.

AB "The condensed matter chemistry" is a new research area in chemistry, the basic idea of which is to study the compositions, structures, properties, preparations and their relationships of matters in multilevels beyond the limitations of molecules and perfect crystals. Based on the brief reviews of the history from the solid state physics to the condensed physics and the history of the solid state chemistry, as well as on the analysis of feature of the solid state of chemistry, it is pointed out that the development of the solid state chemistry must lead to the establishment of "the condensed matter chemistry", and it is referred that many other areas in chemistry would also take "the condensed matter chemistry" as their development direction. The development path for "the condensed matter chemistry" is suggested: completing the knowledge system of the solid state chemistry, expanding the knowledge scope of the solid state chemistry and creating the landmark achievements of "the condensed matter chemistry". It is finally stressed that the condensed matter chemists should reinforce the cooperation with the condensed matter physicists and co-build "the condensed matter science" mansion.

AB Undergraduate chemistry majors should be encouraged to consider chemistry-based solutions to issues that impact their daily lives as well as the lives of poor and marginalized populations worldwide. Some issues that disproportionately influence historically disadvantaged populations are also directly related to or could be impacted by chemistry. This idea of addressing social justice with chemistry is not often addressed in chemistry curricula but has recently gained importance with students and instructors. In response to this challenge and need, a seminar course was developed to assist chemistry majors in connecting chemistry concepts to social justice issues. The seminar course aimed at teaching scientific research and communication skills but thematically added social justice concepts while focusing on chemistry advances that relate to, for example, environmental racism, forensic chemistry, opioid addiction, women's health, and food disparities. Students in this course demonstrated an understanding of recent chemistry research while also expressing compelling connections to social justice challenges.

AB The main challenge in chemistry education is to nurture students' knowledge in developing abstract chemistry concept. Proficiency in chemistry literacy is the foundation in acquiring basic concepts of chemistry, such as chemical interactions at microscopic, macroscopic, symbolic and process level as well as to understand and describe phenomenon scientifically. Objective of this study is to investigate chemistry literacy attainment at nominal, functional, conceptual and multi-dimensional level among high-achiever students in Malaysia. An exploratory research was carried out involving 105 students from high-achiever schools from a state in Malaysia. Students' levels of chemistry literacy was analyzed and measured using Chemistry Literacy Test. The study found that students' nominal chemistry literacy was at satisfactory levels in terms of basic chemistry concepts. Yet, their achievement on functional, conceptual and multi-dimensional levels were unsatisfactory. These results are discussed in relation to the problem-solving skills and interpretation skills of scientific investigation based on real-life situations and chemistry literacy.

AB Over the past several decades, green chemistry has gained prominence in chemistry education. However, the development of green chemistry curricula has not reached all levels of education equally, focusing mainly on elective and upper division courses. We deliberately focused our green chemistry curriculum redesign on a high enrollment introductory general chemistry laboratory course at the University of California, Berkeley. We developed over 30 new experiments that introduced students to green chemistry concepts and applications, while maintaining canonical general chemistry learning goals. The context of the curriculum and required course assignments encouraged students to use green chemistry principles to explore and solve real-world problems. After completing this redesigned course, we hypothesized that students would value green chemistry and feel more confident in their green chemistry knowledge. We developed new methods to measure students' attitudes toward and understanding of green chemistry as a system instead of isolated reactions or processes. These assessments allowed us to better understand both the progression and limitations in student green chemistry and systems-thinking. Since over 2000 students complete the laboratory course each year, we used a combination of fixed response items and free response items from online surveys and in-class assignments and exams. This approach allowed efficient assessment of thousands of students, while still gaining valuable and nuanced views of student understanding and attitudes. These assessments indicated that the new general chemistry laboratory curriculum succeeded in providing an environment in which students learned green chemistry concepts and realized that chemistry has connections to their future courses and professions.

To support this viewpoint, evidence from a wide range of published papers serve as a cogent argument that GC attracts and engages both science and nonscience students, enhances chemistry content knowledge, and improves the image of the field, while preparing the world for a sustainable future. Published pedagogy associated with green and sustainable chemistry is critically reviewed and discussed.

AB The object of chemistry has steadily evolved from discrete molecules to discrete numbers of assembled molecules and finally to networks of constitutional dynamic molecules, introducing the notion of adaptive chemistry. Inorganic coordination chemistry has been at the heart of this evolution with the metamorphosis of metal cations from coordination centers to templates to effectors. This chapter retraces 25 years of advances in metallosupramolecular chemistry by covering the birth and evolution of emblematic concepts such as the concepts of self-organization, self-sorting, constitutional dynamic chemistry, adaptive chemistry, and constitutional dynamic network. Additionally, some key metallosupramolecular structures such as helicates and grids like complexes, cages, and dynamers will be discussed alongside the implementation of motional dynamics in metallosupramolecular chemistry.

AB Marie Stahl and Anita Hussenius have defined what discourses dominate national tests in chemistry for Grade 9 in Sweden by using feminist, critical didactic perspectives. This response seeks to expand the results in Stahl and Hussenius's article Chemistry inside an epistemological community box!-Discursive exclusions and inclusions in the Swedish national tests in chemistry, by using different facets of gender awareness. The first facet-Gender awareness in relations to the test designers' own conceptions- highlighted how the gender order where women are subordinated men becomes visible in the national tests as a consequence of the test designers internalized conceptions. The second facet-Gender awareness in relation to chemistry-discussed the hierarchy between discourses within chemistry. The third facet-Gender awareness in relation to students-problematized chemistry in relation to the students' identity formation. In summary, I suggest that the different discourses can open up new ways to interpret chemistry and perhaps dismantle the hegemonic chemistry discourse.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate high school students' perceptions on chemistry subjects: reasons for choosing chemistry, learning volume and content difficulty, interests, teaching/learning methods, preferable classes etc. A total of 1,087 students who took chemistry subjects at 126 high schools by proportional stratified sampling were voluntarily participated in the survey. The main reasons the students chose chemistry subjects were interests and interests in chemistry, foundation to science, relevance to college majors, and so on. Students recognized that the learning volume and content difficulty as normal level was about 60%. Reasons why chemistry was difficult was that, although there was a difference in degree, chemistry was difficult in itself and had too much things to memorize. In the case of interests in chemistry subjects, students of 43.9% of Chemistry I and 52.0% of Chemistry II recognized the level as normal. The reason why not interested in chemistry subjects was that it was the nature of chemistry contents, or students had neither interests and enjoyment of chemistry nor foundation for chemistry. Classes were mostly lectures but the students preferred mainly experimental activities, or explanation with real-life examples or science stories. The frequency of experimental activities was found to be 1 to 5 times per semester, or not experimented. Research and efforts will be necessary to improve classes and environments for students' experimental activities.

AB Green chemistry and sustainable development have become increasingly important topics for the education of future chemists. The cross-disciplinary nature of green chemistry and sustainable development often means these subjects are taught in conjunction with other subjects, such as organic chemistry and chemical engineering. Herein, a straightforward and efficient approach for vertical integration of green chemistry concepts within existing undergraduate organic chemistry courses is shown. The gradual self-evaluation, "greenification", and reassessment of an organic chemistry course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology from 2013 to 2017 is described, with particular focus on the laboratory course and a novel green chemistry project designed to promote sustainability thinking and reasoning. The laboratory project, which can also be conducted as an independent organic chemistry laboratory exercise, required students to critically evaluate variations of the same Pechmann condensation experiment according to the twelve principles of green chemistry. The course evaluation shows that, after the modifications, students feel more comfortable with the topics "green chemistry" and "sustainability" and consider these topics more important for their future careers. Furthermore, the ability of students to discuss and critically evaluate green chemistry parameters improved considerably as determined from the laboratory project reports.

AB Decades of chemophobia are taking a high toll on chemistry. As current surveys suggest, people are displaying an irrational desire to live in a world without chemistry, but at the same time are unable to answer trivial chemistry questions. Constant questioning of the importance of chemistry induced by chemophobia leads to a weakening of the identity of chemists and can have negative consequences on the reproduction of chemistry. The need for the support of a positive perception of the chemical profession and an offer of positive examples for self-identification is the result. Everyday communication thus becomes the background on which the determination of the identity of the chemist takes place. The new communication strategy, which we call "heroes of chemistry", aims not only to add a much-needed human touch to chemistry communications, but also to create the conditions for strengthening the identity of the chemist.

AB In this paper, several arguments on the positive effect of the incorporation of a chemistry course (based on materials chemistry), common to all engineering undergraduate programs, have been shown. The proposal is supported considering the low percentage of engineering programs that include the chemistry as mandatory subject into the curricula, and both the potential of chemistry to teach science competences and the close association between engineering and materials chemistry. An interesting course performed from different fundamental topics of materials chemistry, and using the pedagogical approach of problem-based learning was proposed.

AB Research has shown that students' science capital has a large impact on their science aspirations and their development of science identities. In this study, we apply the notion of science capital to chemistry education in order to investigate how students make use of science capital in the field of chemistry. We define chemistry capital as a person's resources that help him or her to succeed in the field of chemistry (e.g., parents know chemistry content, sharing chemistry-related activities at home, horizontal ellipsis ). We interviewed 48 secondary school students in Germany and conducted a thematic analysis. It reveals the following. (i) Chemistry capital in the home environment is unevenly distributed. Students who do not have family members who can connect with the mainstream conception of chemistry tend to be concentrated in schools with the lowest entry requirements (Hauptschulen, lower secondary education). Chemistry capital, therefore, tends to be reproduced. (ii) In most cases, families' chemistry capital translates into students' individual chemistry capital. This shows up in a multitude of links between families' chemistry capital and students' individual chemistry capital. (iii) The German school structures tend to aggravate the existing inequalities: this tends to deprive the students from Hauptschulen of qualified chemistry teachers. (iv) In some exceptional cases, students acquire chemistry capital independently from their families' capital. They do so either by following chemistry-related YouTube channels or by developing a chemistry identity as part of a general learner identity. In order to reduce the existing inequalities, there is an urgent need to provide Hauptschulen in Germany with qualified teaching staff for chemistry. If this precondition is met, teaching approaches that focus on identity building and engaging students and their parents in a dialogue about chemistry could potentially be fruitful.

AB There are numerous influential factors contributing to students' successful learning in introductory chemistry courses. One popularized factor is mathematical preparedness as gauged by a prerequisite mathematics grade or a standardized exam score. Less well known factors are students' attitude toward the subject of chemistry or students' involvement with chemistry. In this replication and extension study, students' attitude in introductory chemistry courses, including a chemistry course designed for nursing and allied health students, was measured using the Attitude toward the Subject of Chemistry Inventory. Results show that a low-involvement hierarchy of attitude effect for students' attitude toward chemistry, previously observed after 5 weeks, persists throughout a semester, and is likely widespread in classes across our department. Results also suggest a measurable difference between students' emotional satisfaction with chemistry and their emotional attachment to chemistry, the latter of which is connected with their engagement with chemistry rather than their achievement in chemistry. Students' low-involvement influence on chemistry achievement is being mediated predominantly by the affective subcomponent of their attitude. Attitudes are learned and a low-involvement hierarchy of attitude effect is susceptible to positive change. The results presented herein cement the reliability and generality of previous findings and extend those findings. The hierarchy of attitude effect can serve as a bifocal lens to capture evidence of students' engagement with chemistry learning (learning process) as well as their chemistry achievement (learning product).

AB Many of the principles of organic polymer chemistry are direct extensions of the information contained in the standard introductory organic chemistry course. Often, however, the discussion of macromolecules is relegated to a chapter at the end of the organic chemistry text and is covered briefly, if at all. Connecting the organic-chemical principles of macromolecules to those of small molecules at the time these principles are first presented demonstrates some of the practical implications of organic chemistry, including medical applications. Making these connections can serve as a motivator to many students who are interested in medical applications of organic chemistry. Several examples of how macromolecular principles can be distributed throughout an introductory organic chemistry course to connect basic concepts to everyday life are discussed.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of science writing for different audiences on preservice chemistry teachers' chemistry concept understanding and modeling ability in general chemistry experiment activities using Argument-based Modeling (AbM) strategy. And we also examined preservice chemistry teachers' perceptions of modeling in different audience groups. The participants of the study were 18 university students in the first grade of preservice chemistry teachers taking a general chemistry experiment course. They completed eleven topics of general chemistry experiment using argument-based modeling strategy. The understanding of chemistry concept was compared with the effect size of pre- and post-chemistry concept test scores. To find out modeling ability, we analyzed level of model by each preservice chemistry teacher. Analytical framework for the modeling ability was composed of three elements, explanation, representation, and communication. The questionnaire was conducted to check up on preservice chemistry teacher's recognition of modeling. The result of analyzing the effect of modeling for different audience on the understanding of chemistry concept and modeling ability, the preservice chemistry teachers' were found to be more effective when the level of audience was low. There was no difference in the recognition of modeling between the groups for audience. However, we could confirm that the responses of preservice chemistry teachers are changed in concrete when they have an experience in succession on modeling.

AB To remain relevant, chemists need to be able to understand their work in terms of systems. Since systems thinking is a framework to understand and manage systems, the introduction of systems thinking in chemistry education would assist learners to navigate complex, inter-related concepts typical of systems. At the same time, the adoption of systems thinking in chemistry education will require a major reorientation in how chemistry is taught. We consider several characteristics of system complexity that are key to systems thinking in chemistry-including purpose, scale, boundaries, hierarchies, constraints, loop concepts and emergence-and discuss their introduction in education and the benefits this will bring.

AB Chemistry is the central science for value creation by physical products in the socio-economic system. Unsustainable processes over many decades have led to pressure on the planet and an urgent need for prioritizing sustainable development on a global level. Due to the central role of chemistry, the chemistry profession is an important stakeholder group to shape the transformation towards sustainable development. In order to provide relevant skills, higher education in chemistry requires a view of chemistry in the context of the framework of sustainability and the uptake of new content that is not covered in conventional teaching of chemistry. Such content includes environmental chemistry and toxicology, benign design of chemicals (teaching of chemistry), but also a broader context such as alternative business models and overarching knowledge of international policies and strategies to implement change with respect to chemical industry, chemical products and business (teaching about chemistry) in favor of sustainable development. In this paper, we describe a first of its kind program following this approach: An M.Sc. Sustainable Chemistry. It addresses the above mentioned topics and aims for international professionals of the chemical sector.

AB Secondary chemistry teachers are often concerned with and focused on specific content they need to cover to prepare students for college-level chemistry courses. Contrarily, postsecondary teachers, at times, question or criticize secondary chemistry courses because they feel their students come to college unprepared for their course. Citing research, chemistry student numbers, and course structure, we argue that the expectation of introductory secondary chemistry as a prerequisite course to prepare students for college chemistry is a misguided connection that does not foster successful student learning in either course. We ask instructors at all levels of chemistry to refocus their courses on serving all students in their class, rather than expecting a direct progression from high school to college chemistry.

AB Although principles and practices of green and sustainable chemistry have been articulated for more than 20 years, they have yet to become systemically infused into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. The American Chemical Society Green Chemistry Institute (ACS GCI) has convened stakeholders from across the chemistry education community to develop a strategy and, subsequently, a road map for mainstreaming green and sustainable chemistry concepts and practices into the chemistry curriculum. Through this initiative, a set of core competencies were developed to guide infusion of green and sustainable chemistry knowledge and skills into the curriculum and prepare chemists to make significant contributions to sustainability in the future. The core competencies are described briefly here as well as strategic efforts to develop the road map and to aid the adoption of green and sustainable chemistry into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.

AB The relationship between students' attitude towards chemistry and their successful achievement to the subject have been reported in some published studies. However, a similar study uncovering the correlation between students' confidence to be successful in chemistry and their achievement in chemistry subject is still limited. This study aimed to investigate how students' confidence toward chemistry subject as well as towards chemical kinetics topic boost their achievement in the area of chemical kinetics. 23 first year chemistry students at Universitas Negeri Malang, Indonesia participated in the study. A four-tier instrument in the area of chemical kinetics accompanied by a questionnaire uncovering students' general confidence in chemistry, in the area of physical chemistry and in the topic of chemical kinetics was implemented. The survey was carried out two times, before and after the students experienced chemical kinetic learning in their basic chemistry course. Students' confidence towards chemistry, physical chemistry and chemical kinetics were mirrored to their achievement in the chemical kinetics test provided. The study uncovered that students' confidence to be successful in chemistry course triggered their understanding of chemical kinetics. However, when the confidence was specified in more detailed aspects (confidence towards physical chemistry and chemical kinetics topic), the influences were inconsequential

AB The chemistry curriculum for undergraduate life science majors at Purdue University has been transformed to better meet the needs of this student population and prepare them for future success. The curriculum, called the 1-2-1 curriculum, includes four consecutive and integrated semesters of instruction in general chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, taken by students in their first two years. As part of this curriculum, a one-semester general chemistry course, General Chemistry with a Biological Focus (GCBF), was created and evaluated. The course covers all topics typically taught in general chemistry, but with a shift in emphasis toward topics relevant to chemistry in biological systems. Students who took this new course performed better in subsequent organic chemistry courses compared with their peers who took a traditional two-semester general chemistry course.

AB This case study explored chemistry teacher isolation through the compilation and analysis of contextual characteristics and student performance data of 895 public schools and 2321 chemistry teachers in New York State in 2011-12. Data on the teachers' qualifications along with school characteristics were collected from several independent, publicly available data sources. Chemistry teacher characteristics included professional age, certification type (primary or secondary), and whether the teachers were isolated, that is, the only teachers of chemistry in their schools. School-level data included socioeconomic status, chemistry course-taking rates, and passing rates on the statewide high-stakes chemistry exam. Analysis revealed that more than half of public secondary schools in New York State had isolated chemistry teachers, and they were concentrated in urban schools and had less professional teaching experience. When examining the chemistry performance of students of isolated teachers in a multivariable model, it was determined that school-level socioeconomic status, chemistry-taking ratio, certification type, and professional age were predictors, accounting for 27% of the variance in scores. Results were consistent with mediation analyses indicating both teacher professional age and school test-taking ratio mediated the relationship between socioeconomic status and chemistry passing rate, suggesting that teaching experience and chemistry course-taking rates mitigated the effects of poverty on student chemistry performance. These findings have implications for education policy makers indicating that teacher preparation and induction programs should be re-examined to address: (1) teaching chemistry in isolation and (2) the relationships among school conditions, chemistry teacher retention, and high school chemistry students' achievement.

AB The main challenge in chemistry education is to nurture students' knowledge in developing abstract chemistry concept. Proficiency in chemical literacy is the foundation in acquiring basic concepts of chemistry, such as chemical interactions at microscopic, macroscopic, symbolic, and process level as well as to understand and describe phenomenon scientifically. Objective of this study is to investigate chemistry literacy attainment at nominal, functional, conceptual, and multi-dimensional level among high-achiever students in Malaysia. An exploratory research was carried out involving 65 students from high-achiever schools from a state in Malaysia. Students' levels of chemistry literacy was analyzed and measured using Chemistry Literacy Test. The study found that students' nominal chemistry literacy was at satisfactory levels in terms of basic chemistry concepts. Yet, their achievements on functional, conceptual, and multi-dimensional levels were unsatisfactory. These results are discussed in relation to the problem-solving skills and interpretation skills of scientific investigation based on real-life situations and chemistry literacy.

AB Green chemistry metrics and life-cycle analysis (LCA) were used to assess inefficiencies in two current organic chemistry experiments conducted in third-year organic chemistry to synthesize (E)-stilbene from benzaldehyde. An alternative Wittig-based, greener, one-pot experiment using the same starting material was selected as a vehicle to introduce the concepts of green chemistry to students. The original learning objectives for the experiment were maintained with additional learning objectives in green chemistry introduced. The theoretical and experimental calculations of all experiments were compared using the standard univariate and multivariate metrics for LCA analysis, to assess the impact of chemical waste generated on the environment. The LCA metrics showed that the Wittig-based experiment addressed eight principles of green chemistry and possessed fewer environmental hazards, produced less waste (E-factor), and had better isomeric purity, mass, and process efficiency including factors such as global warming potential than the current lab methods. Results from a survey of students who conducted all three experiments indicated an enhanced knowledge of green chemistry and an improved sense of chemical and environmental impact. The research provided a platform to introduce sustainable chemistry practices to organic chemistry students at the undergraduate level.

AB ACS Examinations provide a lens through which to examine historical changes in topic coverage via analyses of course-specific examinations. This study is an extension of work completed previously by the ACS Exams Research Staff and collaborators in general chemistry, organic chemistry, and physical chemistry to explore content changes in the principal courses of the postsecondary chemistry curriculum. In this study, we consider how inorganic chemistry content coverage has varied over a 55-year period since the first inorganic chemistry ACS Examination was released in 1961. A total of 860 items was evaluated on the basis of problem type (i.e., algorithmic, conceptual, or recall), use of visual-spatial or reference components, and content coverage. Our analyses identify core content areas in the inorganic chemistry curriculum, consistent with those reported in faculty surveys. Each examination also contained questions addressing a variety of specialty areas that vary widely within the discipline between 1961 and 2016. Unlike the results from historical reviews of general chemistry and organic chemistry ACS Examinations, we observe great variability across the 13 inorganic chemistry examinations with an absence of strong trends in inclusion or exclusion of problem types, visual-spatial or reference components, or content across the 13 exams analyzed. Our results offer a framework for using historical ACS Examinations as a tool to make decisions about the future of content coverage in postsecondary inorganic chemistry education.

AB The chemistry education aspect of elementary teacher education faces a unique set of challenges. On one hand, preservice and in-service elementary teachers tend to not like chemistry and have negative feelings toward chemistry. On the other hand, learning chemistry requires reasoning about natural phenomena from the submicroscopic perspective that deals with the properties and behaviors of unobservable particles. The present study addresses these challenges in chemistry education for preservice elementary teachers (PSETs) by designing a chemistry curriculum that improves the relevance of chemistry learning to students via intertextuality and modeling practices. An analysis of chemistry representations that PSETs generated before and after taking the designed chemistry course demonstrates that they initially perceived chemistry as vivid chemical changes occurring in lab spaces or a discipline related to atoms while failing to provide connections between the chemical reactions and atoms. After taking the course, many students came to see doing chemistry as epistemic practices that construct submicroscopic explanations for observable phenomena and its relevance to everyday lives such as food, car emissions, and their local surroundings. They also came to recognize various epistemic roles that people play in doing chemistry. We provide important implications for engaging PSETs in chemical reasoning and designing chemistry curricula that are more approachable and build on learners' knowledge resources.

AB The International Union of Pure & Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) launched a global project in 2017 to infuse systems thinking into chemistry education, motivated in part by the desire to help equip chemists and citizens to better address the complex, global challenges our society currently faces. One important early outcome of the IUPAC Systems Thinking in Chemistry Education (STICE) project is this special issue of the Journal of Chemical Education, which provides a key reference point for the rapidly emerging literature on the incorporation of systems thinking into chemistry education, including its application to green and sustainable chemistry. The STICE project outcomes to date include reviewing systems thinking approaches in other STEM fields, articulating a framework for STICE, identifying aspects of learning theories relevant to learning systems thinking skills in chemistry, using systems thinking approaches to integrate green and sustainability chemistry concepts into university-level chemistry classrooms, and identifying considerations for assessing systems thinking in chemistry education. The authors of this article, who, with others, have provided leadership to the STICE project, conclude this Journal's special issue by briefly reviewing progress to date and identifying three main areas of future work for the application of systems thinking in chemistry education: (1) developing systems thinking resources for chemistry educators and students, (2) identifying chemistry education research needed to investigate and improve systems thinking approaches, and (3) investigating opportunities to apply chemistry-related systems thinking approaches in broader educational contexts. Our intention is to recommend potential opportunities, stimulate conversations, and motivate actions required to successfully equip learners with systems thinking skills in chemistry, such that these learners, citizens of our countries and our planet, are better positioned to interpret and address complex global challenges.

AB While science self-concepts of secondary school students have received considerable attention, several important aspects of chemistry self-concepts have not yet been understood: gender relations, the impact of students' cultural backgrounds, and the impact of chemistry self-concept on learning processes. In the present study, (i) we could confirm our hypothesis that chemistry self-concept is strongly related to learning goal orientations. This part of the study built upon knowledge from educational psychology. Our results open the field for practical interventions designed to influence chemistry self-concepts. (ii) We investigated the gender relations in chemistry self-concept with a special focus on students' cultural backgrounds. The results show that chemistry self-concept differs from science self-concept: the gender gap traditionally described in the literature could not be found. Instead, the study suggests that an interaction of gender and cultural background might influence chemistry self-concepts. (iii) We were interested in the influence of the context of chemistry classroom and language on self-concept. In line with the literature, we found that a good relationship with the chemistry teacher seems to have a positive impact on chemistry self-concept. Also, the perception of chemistry language and chemistry self-concepts were strongly correlated. Suggestions are made for practical interventions based on these findings.

AB The objective of this research was to investigate the level of students attitudes toward Chemistry and Learning Experience (ATCLE). The research sample included 393 students (61 male and 130 female) from three universities; Universitas Negeri Mataram, Universitas Islam Negeri Mataram, and IMP Mataram, Indonesia. The sample has been selected through cluster random sampling and snowballs random sampling. Mixed method research with a descriptive correlational survey model and a semi-structured interview was employed for the study. The data were collected by Chemistry Attitudes and Experiences Questionnaire (CAEQ) and an interview guide. Results showed no significant correlation in the level of attitude toward chemistry based on gender and grades. The finding also revealed that the attitude of pre-service chemistry teachers based on gender and grade were more positive towards research in chemistry than jobs related to chemistry. However, grades influenced the students learning experience, but there was no influence of gender on students learning experience. It is suggested that teachers need to develop a positive attitude toward chemistry and learning experiences of the students through inquiry-based learning practices.

AB Green chemistry is the name of a need, that of encompassing chemistry research and the environmental, safety, health, and societal issues that have been creating unprecedent concerns at a global level. Green chemistry is a modern concept, as the label that represents the entry of chemical sciences in the realm of integrated sustainability studies. To do green chemistry research, we need approaches that take into account the use and availability of resources, as well as the direct or indirect impacts of the applications of new chemistry. Systems thinking is a powerful mindset for addressing the complexity of the interconnections between the traditional and the new aspects of chemistry research. Systems thinking can provide suitable and appropriate conceptual tools for the research, requiring that chemistry teaching provides the necessary familiarity with systemic concepts and practices. In this paper, an emergy (spelled with "m") perspective is presented as suitable to address the green chemistry didactics toward a systemic conceptual framework, which is now more and more mandatory.

AB Chemistry education as an established research field has a relatively short history, starting in the 1970s. It studies the process of learning chemistry content, and so it belongs to the social sciences. Chemistry education research is based on both theory and data, and it produces generalizable and applicable results. The present author started his engagement with chemistry education in the late 1970s, and has followed progress in the field ever since. He has greatly been influenced by J. Dudley Herron's Piagetian views about the learning of chemistry concepts and Alex H. Johnstone's three-level structure of the chemistry content and his information processing model of learning. In this chapter, the focus is on a number of the author's studies and on curriculum and educational material, which relate directly to Greek chemistry education, but also have an international dimension and interest. Challenges and achievements, as well as barriers to the development of Greek chemistry education are reported, plus perspectives for international chemistry education. Short reference is also made to the work of other internationally recognized Greek chemistry educators, who have made and still are making substantial contributions to both Greek and international chemistry education.

AB This research follows the previous study examining the effect of chemistry education on students' perception and understanding to the nature of chemistry (NoC) as well as their attitudes towards it as a school subject. Grade 9 students (N = 282) at the end of their compulsory schooling were given a set of open-ended questions focused on their understanding to NoC, perception of chemistry topics' importance, topics the students found interesting and their evaluation of chemistry as a school subject. The answers were analysed using the open coding approach. It is possible to conclude most of the students do not have a clear idea about the nature of chemistry. Students assess chemistry as a school subject in the middle of the 5 point Likert scale. The results of this research offer the background for a more complex analysis of effects influencing students's conception of chemistry and its subject matter.

AB The presented paper reviews popular science articles (these articles are published in online magazine "The Teacher") as one of the methods of chemistry teaching. It describes which didactic principles they are in line with and how this type of articles can be used in order to kindle the interest of pupils, students and generally, the readers of other specialties, in chemistry. The articles review the main topics of inorganic/organic chemistry, biochemistry and ecological chemistry in a simple and entertaining manner. A part of the articles is about "household" chemistry. Chemical topics are related to poetry, literature, history of chemistry or simply, to fun news. The paper delineates the structure of popular science articles and the features of engaging students. It also reviews the teachers' and students' interview results about the usage of popular science articles in chemistry teaching process. The aforementioned pedagogical study revealed that the popular science articles contain useful information not only for the students of other specialties, but also for future biologists and ecologists (having chemistry as a mandatory subject at their universities). The articles are effectively used by teachers on chemistry lessons to kindle students' interest in this subject.

AB There are many factors that shape students' attitudes toward science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This exploratory study of high school students examined the effect of enriching chemistry with math on chemistry students' attitudes toward math and careers involving math. To measure student attitudes, a survey was administered before and after the 18-week chemistry class; results from the chemistry class were compared to survey results from students in an elective science class that did not emphasize mathematics. At the end of the 18-week period, only the chemistry students exhibited more positive views toward their abilities in mathematics and careers that involve mathematics, as compared to their views at the outset of the course. To ensure that chemistry mastery was not hindered by the additional emphasis on math, and that mastery on state end-of-course examinations reflected knowledge acquired during the math-intensive chemistry class, a chemistry progress test was administered at the start and end of the term. This exploratory study suggests that emphasizing mathematical approaches in chemistry may positively influence attitudes toward math in general, as well as foster mastery of chemistry content.

AB General chemistry is an important public basic course in agricultural colleges and universities with broad audience and wide application. It is not only the basis for subsequent analytical chemistry, organic chemistry and physical chemistry, but also it is closely related to the specialized courses of biochemistry, environmental chemistry, soil chemistry, food chemistry and so on. General chemistry mainly introduces the basic principles of chemical reaction, the four balances in solution, and the basic knowledge of material structure. It has the characteristics of less time, much content, and some knowledge abstract and difficult to understand. In the classroom, the new media technology and the traditional teaching content are combined to improve the teaching methods, which can make the course content more interesting and more attractive. After class, the establishment of quality course website, discussion groups, and public network channels can help students learn autonomously, timely and effectively solve the problems in the study, strengthen mutual communication between teachers and students, expand their horizons in general chemistry learning, and ultimately achieve the purpose of improving teaching quality.

AB The principle of frustrated Lewis acid/base pairs has reached gold chemistry. Based on sterical repulsion at the gold center, an otherwise typical coordination can be prevented, which induces new reactivity patterns. This review explains the basic principles and the development of this type of chemistry, and then summarizes the latest developments in this quickly-moving field. In addition, the future perspectives for combining stoichiometric gold chemistry and gold catalysis with FLP chemistry are discussed.

AB Understanding the nature of chemical thinking and action, as well as their application and impact on our world should be central goals of chemistry education at all educational levels. However, traditional school chemistry is still mostly focused on having students learn the body of declarative knowledge built over the years in the discipline. Achieving changes in curriculum and teaching practices in this context remains a challenging task. Studies in the history and philosophy of the discipline suggest that chemistry has unique characteristics that need to be recognised and considered in chemistry education. Many of these studies point to a pluralism in the discipline, and in the understanding of and about chemistry, that should be characterised and incorporated into our educational models. In this essay, we have attempted to build such a characterisation using conceptual profiles theory to propose a framework that can be used to enrich and support the thinking and action of chemistry teachers at all educational levels.

AB This chapter characterises quantum chemistry, the main reducing agent in chemistry, as a Lakatosian research programme. The attraction of the concept of a research programme is that it allows us to think of quantum chemistry not as a single theory, but as a succession (or network) of co-operating theories. This in turn allows for a more balanced discussion on how quantum chemistry can be characterised as a reducing theory. It also allows us to consider a number of questions on the internal structure of quantum chemistry, such as the question whether quantum chemistry is a progressive or degenerating research programme.

AB The Science of Human Health is an undergraduate chemistry course for non-science majors. This course presents chemistry content following a systems thinking approach and was created with the goal of providing students with the necessary chemistry foundation to make informed decisions which will affect their own well-being and their global citizenship. Chemistry is taught and learned on a need-to-know basis in order to address the three themes: nutrition for the prevention of disease, diagnostics for the detection of disease, and medicine for the treatment of disease. The course relies heavily on active learning assignments and group work, promoting the development of critical thinking and communication skills. Presenting chemistry with a systems thinking orientation through the context of human health and well-being is particularly effective at engaging non-science students who might otherwise struggle to relate to chemistry.

AB Supramolecular chemistry, one of the topical fields of contemporary chemistry, deals sometimes with subtle interactions, sophisticated molecules, and huge molecular aggregates. Furthermore, many terms such as molecular self-assembly, mechanically-interlocked molecular architectures, container-molecule, and cryptand, may sound abstract and sometimes discouraging. The purpose of this paper is to show how a chemistry teacher can scrutinize supramolecular chemistry in terms of everyday chemistry. Four directions which can help to a better understanding of this domain are identified and analyzed. Simple synthetic procedures for most of the supramolecular receptors, the occurrence of supramolecular chemistry in Nature, the connection between supramolecular chemistry and life itself (self-assembly of nucleic acid bases) are useful examples for emphasizing the versatility of this domain. Last, but not least, the presence of supramolecular chemistry in food, drugs, drinks, tobacco-based products, homecare products, cosmetics, are relevant examples of how this concept is present in everyday life.

AB Continuous manufacturing and Green Chemistry, are two promising approaches to synthesis with underutilized potential that are gaining traction by the wider pharmaceutical community. We review Green Chemistry advances resulting when transitioning to continuous manufacturing with focus on Green Chemistry elements inherent in flow chemistry and related separation processes. Case studies of continuous manufacturing represented by the F-3 (Flexible, Fast, and Future) project, cGPM manufacturing at Eli Lilly, and the MIT pharmaceuticals on demand projects provide examples of Green Chemistry advances realised. Throughout the review, Green Chemistry advances are identified in terms of the pertinent principles of Green Chemistry. A count of the occurrences of the different principles of Green Chemistry reveals that the principle of prevention greatly overshadows all other principles.

AB The purpose of this descriptive case study was to develop pre-service chemistry teachers' Technological Pedagogical Science Knowledge (TPASK) through novel computational chemistry modules. The study consisted of two phases starting with designing a computational chemistry based learning environment followed by a case study where students' perceptions towards educational computational chemistry were explored. First, we designed an authentic research-based chemistry learning module that supported problem-based learning through the utilisation of computational chemistry methods suitable for pre-service chemistry education. The objective of the learning module was to promote learning of specific chemistry knowledge and development of scientific skills. Systematic design decisions were made through the TPASK framework. The learning module was designed for a third-year physical chemistry course taken by pre-service chemistry teachers in Chile. After the design phase, the learning module was implemented in a course, and students' perceptions were gathered using semi-structured group interviews. The sample consisted of 22 pre-service chemistry teachers. Data were analysed through qualitative content analysis using the same TPASK framework employed in the learning module design. Based on our findings, pre-service chemistry teachers first acquired Technological Scientific Knowledge (TSK) and then developed some elements of their TPASK. Besides, they highly appreciated the combination of student-centred problem-based learning and the use of computational chemistry tools. Students felt the educational computational learning environment supported their own knowledge acquisition and expressed an interest in applying similar learning environments in their future teaching careers. This case study demonstrates that learning through authentic real-world problems using educational computational methods offers great potential in supporting pre-service teachers' instruction in the science of chemistry and pedagogy. For further research in the TPASK framework, we propose there would be significant benefit from developing new learning environments of this nature and evaluating their utility in pre-service and in-service chemistry teacher's education.

AB In its simplest form, green chemistry may be defined as the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the generation of hazardous substances. The brief history of green chemistry is marked with extraordinary creativity and accomplishments in meeting the "triple bottom line" of sustainability in economic, social, and environmental performance. Green chemistry is about redesigning chemical processes from the ground up, and it goes hand in hand with the sustainable practice of chemistry. We need to start at the undergraduate level, and to provide a better foundation in green chemistry and systems thinking if we are to prepare a generation of chemists able to respond to the grand challenges of sustainability.

AB Making industry greener: Many principles for the economic production of organic bulk chemicals, the syntheses of which have potentially the highest environmental impact, currently overlap with principles of green chemistry. However, there remain enough challenges in making industrial organic synthesis even greener while keeping them efficient, which requires research and innovative processes. How efficient industrial organic chemistry can go hand in hand with principles of green chemistry is reflected in this Science Voices article.

AB Supramolecular chemistry is a central topic in modern chemistry. It touches on many traditional disciplines, such as organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, materials chemistry, environmental chemistry, and biological chemistry. Supramolecular hosts, inter alia macrocyclic hosts, play critical roles in supramolecular chemistry. Calix[4]pyrroles, non-aromatic tetrapyrrolic macrocycles defined by sp(3) hybridized meso bridges, have proved to be versatile receptors for neutral species, anions, and cations, as well as ion pairs. Compared to the parent system, octamethylcalix[4]pyrrole and its derivatives bearing simple appended functionalities, strapped calix[4]pyrroles typically display enhanced binding affinities and selectivities. In this review, we summarize advances in the design and synthesis of strapped calix[4]pyrroles, as well as their broad utility in molecular recognition, supramolecular extraction, separation technology, ion transport, and as agents capable of inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. Future challenges within this sub-field are also discussed.

AB Chemistry plays an important role in developing scientific theories to describe, explain, and predict the physical world and to produce useful products for improving quality of life throughout history. To arouse student awareness of the value and importance of learning chemistry and becoming chemistry literate, we propose an application of systems thinking for the practice of chemistry education. The underlying goals of the systems thinking learning strategy proposed in this article are to help students build core knowledge of chemistry, construct interconnections of chemical concepts, understand the process- and purpose-based nature of systems thinking, and develop appropriate actions for the sustainability of the environment. The conceptual framework includes understanding system structure, complex behavior, and systems at different scales in chemistry and enhancing the interactions and impacts of these aspects, which are used to analyze the chemistry curricular standards in high schools in Israel, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and the United States. The results show that there is an international trend to enhance students' thinking of interconnections of concepts and relevance in chemistry, yet the degree of emphasis varies. With such an approach to promoting systems thinking, we expect students to better understand chemistry, link their knowledge and skills in chemistry to contexts, and appreciate the contribution of chemistry in sustainable development as global citizens.

The subject of this study consisted of 251 second-year high school students in Yogyakarta. The data were collected by a test to measure chemistry contexts, chemistry knowledge, and chemistry competency aspects, and a questionnaire to measure attitude aspect that was developed in previous study. The students' level of chemistry literacy for the aspects were in moderate level. Therefore, some sub aspects had a low and very low category, it might be caused by the lack of teachers' ability to applied learning strategy for developing students' chemistry literacy ability.

AB The impact of students' affective state on success in entry-level chemistry classes is often underestimated or overlooked. Despite learning theory stating the importance of other variables such as students' affective state, instructors often hold true that students' cognitive and mathematical abilities are all that relate to mastering chemistry. The academic barrier to enroll in introductory chemistry classes is typically a passing grade in a mathematics prerequisite class. Many students will likely encounter affective domain barriers to content mastery in chemistry, which are not addressed by mathematics prerequisites. Driven by the long-term goal to improve student success and learning in entry-level chemistry classes, students' affective state was evaluated using a chemistry self-concept inventory. This work reveals action items that could positively impact students' achievement in chemistry.

AB Objective. To show why medicinal chemistry must be a key component of the education of pharmacy students, as well as in the pharmacist's practice.
   Findings. Five case reports were selected by their clinically relevant elements of medicinal chemistry and were explained using structure-activity relationship data of the drugs involved in the case easily obtained from primary literature and in medicinal chemistry textbooks.
   Summary. This paper demonstrates how critical clinical decisions can be addressed using medicinal chemistry knowledge. While such knowledge may not explain all clinical decisions, medicinal chemistry concepts are essential for the education of pharmacy students to explain drug action in general and clinical decisions.

AB Click chemistry has great potential for use in binding between nucleic acids, lipids, proteins, and other molecules, and has been used in many research fields because of its beneficial characteristics, including high yield, high specificity, and simplicity. The recent development of copper-free and less cytotoxic click chemistry reactions has allowed for the application of click chemistry to the field of medicine. Moreover, metabolic glycoengineering allows for the direct modification of living cells with substrates for click chemistry either in vitro or in vivo. As such, click chemistry has become a powerful tool for cell transplantation and drug delivery. In this review, we describe some applications of click chemistry for cell engineering in cell transplantation and for drug delivery in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.

AB The pursuit of greener, more sustainable chemistry has increased over the past 20 years, and there are now multiple journals, books, conferences, and workshops produced every year. With all this activity, it is important to step back and assess the extent to which green and sustainable chemistry research is being translated to commercial applications. There have been several studies of the patent literature in the past that have addressed the question of if green chemistry is affecting government policy and which areas of innovation are being advanced from a green and sustainable chemistry perspective. None of these studies have addressed the details of the chemistry or the areas of societal concern that have prompted green and sustainable chemistry research in academia. This study has attempted to answer the question of if green and sustainable chemistry is being translated into patentable innovations, in which areas, and to what extent.

AB In its simplest form, green chemistry may be defined as the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the generation of hazardous substances. The brief history of green chemistry is marked with extraordinary creativity and accomplishments in meeting the "triple bottom line" of sustainability in economic, social, and environmental performance. Green chemistry is about redesigning chemical processes from the ground up, and it goes hand in hand with the sustainable practice of chemistry. We need to start at the undergraduate level, and to provide a better foundation in green chemistry and systems thinking if we are to prepare a generation of chemists able to respond to the grand challenges of sustainability.

AB Green chemistry and sustainability have garnered more awareness in the chemical industry in recent years, but green chemistry dasses are still not commonplace for either the undergraduate or graduate student curriculum. Additionally, many departments are seeking avenues to reach greater numbers and types of learners through online courses. To address both needs, a small group of chemistry graduate students set out to design a 3-credit-hour upper-level online green chemistry course targeted at students most likely to apply green chemistry concepts in their future careers. The goals for the course included education in the basics of green chemistry (history, metrics, methodologies) along with opportunities to apply what they have learned and communicate it to a general audience. This process of developing modules and assessments for the discovery and application of green chemistry principles has enabled a supplementary education for the graduate students as well. Herein, the specific motivations of the graduate students to design the course, how green chemistry was presented to students in an online format, and how students responded to this type of class are provided.

AB Among the sciences, the position of chemistry in communicating beneficial applications is often fraught with the challenge of applying fundamental concepts to complex real-world situations. This tension is playing out at present as people are accessing a variety of sources, some much less reliable than others, in their decision making about whether to trust emerging vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. This editorial speaks to the need to address the issue of differences in the public trust about different aspects of chemistry. A disparity of trust among many members of the general public between long-familiar consumer products, such as the glues and adhesives being featured in National Chemistry Week in 2020, and new and arguably more complex applications in confronting the current pandemic calls for a response from chemistry educators.

TI Smart Cycle Chemistry Alarms: Intelligent, Actionable Alarms
SO POWERPLANT CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Fossil and combined cycle power plant operations continue to evolve and introduce new challenges to the management of the cycle chemistry program. Two of the main drivers have been cost reduction and increased flexible operation. This has led to a reduction in cycle chemistry expertise at plants, while there has been a simultaneous increase in the complexity of managing the chemistry program. The development of smart cycle chemistry alarms is a methodology to respond to these challenges and improve corrosion and deposition control at power plants. The concept is simple: use independent signals to diagnose and confirm excursions and chemistry events as they occur in the power plant so that non-expert personnel can respond appropriately. This paper discusses the philosophy for developing smart alarms. It builds on cycle chemistry validation work presented at previous Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) International Cycle Chemistry conferences and will include some application examples of the EPRI approach to smart cycle chemistry alarms.

AB Educational games and experiential learning experiences are integral alternative learning tools, growing in popularity in postsecondary classrooms. As the introduction of green chemistry concepts, and by extension polymer chemistry, continues to grow, the need for alternative learning tools describing the synthesis, function, and design of polymers is increasing. In response, we describe a series of functional group and polymer chemistry games and hands-on activities including a card game, boardgame, and bioplastic synthesis activity. A unique group molecule building quiz is also described as a related assessment method. The activities were introduced over two years in a second-year Materials Chemistry for Engineers course, approximately 170 students per year. Overall, the activities were well received by students and provided them with an entertaining way to review first-year chemistry concepts, introduce polymer properties, and apply their own design skills to an application. Students reported the games and activities as being enjoyable as well as helpful in understanding material and polymer chemistry concepts.

First- and second-year students learned general chemistry concepts and laboratory skills in the context of snow chemistry while participating in the course-based undergraduate research experience. Students were guided through all steps of the research process, including research question development, data collection and processing, interpretation of results in the context of scientific literature, and both written and oral presentations. A key component of the course was an individual laboratory experiment in which snow samples from the Arctic were analyzed for pH and ion content. Assessment of the course via pre- and postcourse surveys indicated that students, the majority of whom were women, experienced greater gains in confidence of research skills and general attitudes toward chemistry as compared to the traditional general chemistry laboratory course. This course represents a novel integration of environmental chemistry research into an introductory level chemistry laboratory course, and this approach has significant potential to increase student engagement in the sciences.

ID OXIDATION
AB The demand for sustainable synthetic methods has motivated the development of a myriad of strategies for substrate oxidation chemistry that reflect the goals of green chemistry. Here we present a two-part laboratory module that provides undergraduate chemistry students hands-on experience with the concepts of sustainable chemistry in the context of C-N bond-forming chemistry. First, students perform a traditional Pd-catalyzed C-N cross-coupling reaction between an aryl halide and an amine (i.e., C-X/N-H coupling). In the second part, students investigate a hypervalent iodine-catalyzed reaction that uses O-2 as a terminal oxidant for direct C-H/N-H coupling. On the basis of these two methods for accessing the same arylated amine product, students evaluate aspects of sustainability qualitatively by discussing the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry and quantitatively via green chemistry metric pentagons. These investigations highlight the complex balance of variables that must be considered when evaluating the sustainability of chemical processes. Through these activities, students explore the concepts of aerobic oxidation, hypervalency, green chemistry, and organocatalysis, while enforcing laboratory skills such as Schlenk-line technique, gas handling, and NMR spectroscopy.

DT Review
ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; ARGUMENTATION SKILLS; EDUCATION
AB Laboratory experiences are essential for learning science like chemistry. Learning of abstract concepts occurs more concretely in a laboratory setting. A good pedagogical strategy is essential as the laboratory affects students' learning and what they take away from a laboratory course. In addressing the shortfalls of the existing laboratory, green chemistry experiments were designed and researched on the appropriateness to teach secondary level chemistry. Following a series of workshops on green chemistry experiments, 70 secondary school teachers observed that green chemistry experiments are in accordance with the current syllabus, are feasible to implement, possess the characteristics of encouraging inquiry, being safe and relevant. Additionally, the green chemistry experiments embrace the cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains. The experiments resolved several challenges emerging from operating the traditional lab. The findings of this study suggest green chemistry possesses the potential to be integrated into mainstream chemistry education.

AB Human society actually faces many environmental challenges such as environmental pollution, climate changes and loss of biodiversity. These issues induce major risks for ecosystems and are a serious threat for further life on Earth. Anthropogenic pressure may continue to exacerbate the present-day problems. Prevention and mitigation of environmental issues demands sound science and dedicated political support. For that, environmental chemistry is a central and multidisciplinary science that will provide new concepts and applied methods to solve actual environmental issues. Here, we outline the scope of environmental chemistry. The Anthropocene era and major chemical disasters are discussed. We present also the challenges of atmospheric chemistry, analytical chemistry, statistics and chemometrics, and education in environmental chemistry.

TI What History Tells Us about the Distinct Nature of Chemistry
SO AMBIX

DT Article
AB Attention to the history of chemistry can help us recognise the characteristics of chemistry that have helped to maintain it as a separate scientific discipline with a unique identity. Three such features are highlighted in this paper. First, chemistry has maintained a distinct type of theoretical thinking, independent from that of physics even in the era of quantum chemistry. Second, chemical research has always been shaped by its ineliminable practical relevance and usefulness. Third, the lived experience of chemistry, spanning the laboratory, the classroom and everyday life, is distinctive in its multidimensional sensuousness. Furthermore, I argue that the combination of these three features makes chemistry an exemplary science.

AB The Anthropocene, the geological force of the humankind or The Age of Humans implies new processes of reflection on the complexity of our environmental and planetary reality. The discussion on the concept of Anthropocene and its consequences in the academy, in teaching and society should emerge on us a necessary process of a dialogue between different knowledges and an environmental contextualization in teaching chemistry. In this article, we propose a reflection in relation to the environmental education and teaching chemistry in this scenario in three topics: a) the environmental education and the Anthropocene, b) the Anthropocene and environmental chemistry and c) teaching chemistry and Anthropocene. The relationships among the planetary complexity, the environmental education and social learning are arisen for the discussion on Anthropecene, as well as the approach of planetary limits in teaching Chemistry. In the context of teaching Chemistry and the Anthropecene, three topics were selected for didactic planning classes that have already been used for regular and young-adults high schools in the state of Rio de Janeiro, which were: a) green house gases, global warming and teaching Chemistry, b) urban solid wastes and teaching chemistry and c) plastics and teaching Chemistry.

AB The mark of a great preceptor is the desire to communicate a functional way of thinking about chemistry. One of the best teachers of chemistry was Linus Pauling. He created workable schemes to make sense of the actual data of chemistry that could be taught to elementary students and every person interested in chemistry. His classic elementary text, General Chemistry, remains readable today and is still worth teaching.

AB Indigenous Australians are significantly underrepresented in chemistry based professions, which arises from their low participation in physical science subjects in secondary and tertiary education. This is a multifaceted issue with a number of identified solutions, one of which is to link chemistry with aspects of Indigenous culture. Here, four modules are presented that examine traditional Indigenous Australian practices in detail through a chemistry perspective. These modules assist students to better identify with chemistry principles and therefore encourage further inquiry. The first module is based on toxin removal from plant seeds through water solubility; the second is based on the medicinal properties of the tea tree, which results from isomers of organic compounds. The third module presents color hues of ochre pigments, which are dependent on inorganic chemistry, and the fourth module utilizes plant resin adhesive properties, which are based on glass transition temperatures. These modules have been assessed with Indigenous and non-Indigenous students, who demonstrated increased interest in chemistry. There is also encouraging evidence that these modules have assisted students in taking up additional chemistry subjects.

AB Micellar catalysis has become an important aspect of the chemical industry's effort to "go green". However, this chemistry has yet to be fully explored in educational settings such as second-year organic chemistry laboratories. Reported herein is a discovery-based nucleophilic aromatic substitution experiment that introduces chemistry students to micellar catalysis, green chemistry, and systems thinking. The students prepare tandem reactions in water to explore how the leaving group identity affects the rate of reaction and how the reaction incorporates principles of green chemistry. The product of the fastest reaction is isolated through recrystallization, and the product's identity is verified through infrared spectroscopy and melting point analysis.

In order to accomplish this goal, specific subdisciplinary versions of the map share the two top levels but distinguish themselves at the bottom two levels which contain finer-grained content details. This structure has been refined and vetted over a number of meetings and workshops. This paper presents the four levels of the content map for physical chemistry.

AB During their high-temperature oxidation, complex hydrocarbons and their early fragments are short-lived and figure prominently only during the pyrolysis stage. However, they are quickly replaced by smaller hydrocarbons at the onset of the oxidation stage, resulting in simpler chemistry requirements past pyrolysis. In this study, we develop a data-based hybrid chemistry approach to accelerate chemistry integration for complex fuels. The approach is based on tracking the evolution of chemistry through representative species for the pyrolysis and coupling their reactions with simpler foundational chemistry. The selection of these representative species is implemented using principal component analysis (PCA) based on simulation data. The description of chemistry for the representative species is implemented using an artificial neural network (ANN) model for their reaction rates followed by the description of their chemistry using a foundational chemistry model. The selection of the transition between these models is trained a priori using an ANN pattern recognition classifier. This data-based hybrid chemistry acceleration model is demonstrated for three fuels: n-dodecane, n-heptane and n-decane and investigated with two foundational chemistry, C-0-C-2 and C-0-C-4 , models. The hybrid scheme results in computational saving, up to one order of magnitude for n-dodecane, two orders of magnitudes for n-heptane, and three orders of magnitudes for n-decane. The accuracy and saving in computational cost depend on the number of selected species and the size of the used foundational chemistry. The hybrid model coupled with the more detailed C-0-C-4 foundational performs, overall, better than the one coupled with the C-0-C-2 foundational chemistry. (C) 2020 The Combustion Institute.

AB An interdisciplinary laboratory experiment was designed and carried out on the basis of the photo/electrochromism of N,N'-bis(cysteine)pyromellitic diimide (BCPD), suitable for organic chemistry laboratory I and physical chemistry laboratory II students. In the organic chemistry laboratory, students synthesized BCPD and studied its photo/electrochromic properties briefly. In the physical chemistry laboratory, students were asked to explore the photo/electrochemistry of the synthesized dimide through the use of various techniques such as UV-vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and conductometry measurements. By conducting this experiment, students not only learned the basic chemical concepts and techniques, such as photo/electrochemistry of imides, the use of reflux technique in organic synthesis, UV-vis spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry, but also perceived the interdisciplinary nature of chemistry research. Altogether, this experiment was designed to engage students in chemistry by connecting education to real-life situations, as well as indicating that their products in organic chemistry laboratory are valuable compounds.

AB What is the history and justification of the claim that chemistry is "the central science"? Are our students able to see and appreciate such centrality of the knowledge of chemistry in the curriculum as well as in its broader interconnections with other fields of study and with societal issues? In this editorial for the special issue Reimagining Chemistry Education: Systems Thinking, and Green and Sustainable Chemistry, we, as guest editors, highlight the case made in the collective contributions to the special issue that systems thinking, including green and sustainable chemistry, shows promise as an approach to help chemistry students zoom out from detailed and fragmented disciplinary content to obtain a more holistic view of chemistry and its integral connection to earth and societal systems. Indeed, we ask the following question: How can we as a community of chemists and chemistry educators live up to the claim of being practitioners of the central science if we do not equip our students to engage in systems thinking? We further invite the community to make use of and build upon the contributions in this special issue and participate in a paradigm change in chemistry education that will help prepare our students to be citizens and scientists who are better equipped to deal with the grand challenges in the world.

AB The rich symbolism and mathematical modeling of chemical and physical phenomena used in physical chemistry are meaningful to most physical chemistry instructors, but often less so for students. An exploration of the use of mathematics in physical chemistry provides insights for instructors as to how to better support students in meaningful application of mathematical relationships. This chapter highlights some of the roles mathematics plays in physical chemistry as well as areas where students struggle to make connections between the mathematics and the physical chemistry concepts or phenomena they represent.

AB Most junior high school students considered chemistry as a complicated science subject with an abstract concept, symbols, and terms that must be memorized. The difficulty of learning chemistry made students had low positive perceptions of chemistry. It was needed the right ways to introduce chemistry to them. The purpose of the multiple case study was to explore chemistry multimedia could help students understood chemistry and created a good impression. The study was conducted in three 7th grade classes in different schools. Classroom observations were done in four meetings to collect students' responses toward this multimedia by ending students filling out a questionnaire of impression. Test of classification of matter and its change was given in the last meeting to investigate the level of students' understanding In the way to gain more depth information, two students from each class were an interview about the application of multimedia. The chemistry multimedia made it easier for the teacher to introduce chemistry through a podcast, molymod-like, and digital simulation. This study documented that the appearance of this multimedia could make the students attracted and curious about chemistry.

AB This work provides a description of our experience with designing and implementing green chemistry elements in higher education. It addresses the problem of content and methodology in green chemistry education and provides models of innovative approaches in design and teaching practices.
   An introductory course, Pollution Prevention, Green Chemistry and Green Engineering, supported by a grant from Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, was designed at Grand Valley State University (GVSU), in Michigan, in 2008 and run for the first time in 2009, with 12 students. The positive response from the students who took the class coupled with increasing visibility of green chemistry initiative at the state level (MI Governor's Green Chemistry directive and Green Chemistry Round Table) led the GVSU administration to recognize the need of such a course and, after revision, to its inclusion into the Chemistry Department curriculum, under the designation "Introduction to green chemistry", CHM 111. This remains to be a sought-after course for freshmen and upper-level undergraduates interested in the issues of green chemistry who have no chemistry background in their education. Since 2011, the course ran twice a year with a total of 302 students to date (December 2017). From semester to semester, it underwent several modifications, in order to accommodate the most recent, up-to-date developments in green chemistry and green engineering. The repository of teaching materials created is growing continuously. The progress and lessons learned throughout the years in running this course are summarized here.

AB William Henry was a model preceptor of Chemistry. He created a coherent paradigm for all of Chemistry in the early 19th century based on the notion of Daltonian atoms. His classic text, The Elements of Experimental Chemistry, was used throughout the world for more than 50 years. He taught everyone from Natural Philosophers to Pharmacist Assistants. They all gained a sound perspective on the practice of Chemistry.

AB Recent developments in the chemistry of the transuranic elements are surveyed, with particular emphasis on computational contributions. Examples are drawn from molecular coordination and organometallic chemistry, and from the study of extended solid systems. The role of the metal valence orbitals in covalent bonding is a particular focus, especially the consequences of the stabilization of the 5f orbitals as the actinide series is traversed. The fledgling chemistry of transuranic elements in the + II oxidation state is highlighted. Throughout, the symbiotic interplay of experimental and computational studies is emphasized; the extraordinary challenges of experimental transuranic chemistry afford computational chemistry a particularly valuable role at the frontier of the periodic table.

   INQUIRY; CONTEXT
AB The high-school chemistry curriculum is loaded with many important chemical concepts that are taught at the high-school level and it is therefore very difficult to add modern contents to the existing curriculum. However, many studies have underscored the importance of integrating modern chemistry contents such as nanotechnology into a high-school curriculum. When students are exposed to nanotechnology, they perceive chemistry as more relevant to their life, and more modern than the chemistry they usually study at school, and consequently, their continuous motivation to study chemistry and related subjects increases. In the current study we identified topics in the high-school chemistry curriculum in Israel into which the essential nano-scale science and technology (NST) concepts can be integrated. Insertion points for all 8 NST essential concepts were found. We discuss the importance of ways in which chemistry educators can implement the results for updating the chemistry curriculum, thus making it more modern and relevant to the actual chemistry research that is conducted.

AB The ability to design reaction networks with high, but addressable complexity is a necessary prerequisite to make advanced functional chemical systems. Dynamic combinatorial chemistry has, proven to be a useful tool in achieving complexity, however with some limitations in controlling it. Herein we introduce the concept of antiparallel: chemistries, in which the same functional group can be channeled into one of two reversible chemistries depending on a controllable parameter. Such systems allow both for achieving complexity, by combinatorial chemistry,, and addressing it, by switching from one chemistry to another by controlling an external parameter. In our design the two antiparallel chemistries are thiol disulfide exchange and thio-Michael addition, sharing the thiol as the common building block. By means of oxidation and reduction the system can be reversibly switched from predominantly thio-Michael chemistry to predominantly disulfide chemistry, as well as to any intermediate state. Both chemistries operate in water, at room temperature, and at mildly basic pH, which makes them' a suitable platform for further development of systems chemistry.

AB Educators are constantly looking to improve their pedagogical strategies. This can range from teaching strategies for a specific topic to holistic curriculum changes. Recently, the approach that chemistry departments have chosen to deliver their introductory courses has garnished increasing attention from educators. Our department recently converted our introductory sequence from the traditional two semesters of general chemistry followed by two semesters of organic chemistry to what is often referred to as the 1-2-1 sequence. The 1-2-1 sequence is an introductory sequence in which students take General Chemistry I followed by Organic Chemistry I and II and last General Chemistry II as the fourth introductory course in the introductory sequence. The conversion was motivated by the need to implement a curriculum that more effectively addressed our students' needs and deficiencies and to more effectively utilize department resources to service chemistry majors and the college. The work here highlights the motivation for the conversion, insight into its implementation, and a preliminary investigation on how this change has impacted the Organic Chemistry I class.

AB The 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry highlighted another spectacular achievement in structural chemistry and supramolecular chemistry. The three awardees built molecular machines based on their intimate knowledge of molecular properties and behavior. One of the three laureates, J. Fraser Stoddart, with two co-authors, published an invited paper in 1999 in our journal in which they surveyed the interplay between the synthesis of functioning supramolecular systems and their X-ray crystallographic investigation. Structural Chemistry congratulates Stoddart and his co-laureates on this momentous occasion.

AB Participation in science is unevenly distributed among secondary school students, depending on gender, social class, and ethnicity. In the present study, the influence of the home environment on students' chemistry self-concept is investigated as a factor for explaining participation in science. For this, the sociological lens of chemistry capital is employed. A mixed methods study (N=48) was conducted using quantitative data about self-concept and related variables (need for cognition, incremental theory, perception of language) and qualitative interview data on chemistry capital. The data suggest that chemistry self-concept is not related to chemistry capital in quantitative terms. However, the investigation of the qualitative dimensions suggests that chemistry capital in the home environment might change the frame of reference against the backdrop of which students interpret their abilities. We propose the interpretation that students compare their abilities in chemistry with significant others at home. If parents possess chemistry capital, this might lead to more negative evaluations of their abilities which can be counterbalanced by comparisons with classmates. If parents do not possess chemistry capital, the students might perceive themselves as more competent. Further investigations are needed to test this hypothesis. The results and the integrative mixed method approach will be discussed.

AB gateway to many STEM degrees. A high level of preparedness and motivation to succeed in STEM coursework correlates with success in general chemistry courses, and general chemistry is vital to persistence of students in STEM. Studies have indicated that an increasing number of students, especially underrepresented minority populations, placed into preparatory chemistry courses do not advance to general chemistry. This lack of advancement is an indicator that a one-size-fits-all preparatory chemistry course does not sufficiently target students' cognitive and non-cognitive needs. In order to better support, prepare, and motivate students in STEM at UC Davis, an online, adaptive-responsive summer preparatory chemistry course (SP-Chem using ALEKS) was piloted as an alternative to placement exams and the fall, classroom-based preparatory chemistry course (WLD-41C) used for placement into general chemistry. Student performance in general chemistry was comparatively evaluated for four placement paths (SP-Chem, WLD-41C, placement exams, and repeating the course). Additionally, indicators of STEM persistence, namely student motivation and STEM identity, were surveyed and comparatively evaluated. Our findings of the effectiveness of an online, adaptive-responsive preparatory chemistry course, using both cognitive and non-cognitive measures, demonstrate the promise that online learning during the summer holds for improving student performance and persistence in general chemistry and STEM coursework.

SO PHYSICAL SCIENCES REVIEWS

DE Green Chemistry; education; sustainability; Sustainable Development
ID CONTEXT; DESIGN
AB When the author first became involved with the Green Chemistry movement, he noted that his colleagues in industry who were involved in one of the ACS Green Chemistry Institute (R) industrial roundtables emphasized the take-home message they described as the "triple bottom line." They noted that introducing Green Chemistry in industrial settings had economic, social, and environmental benefits. As someone who first went to school at age 5, and has been "going to school" most days for 65 years, it was easy for the author to see why introducing Green Chemistry into academics had similar beneficial effects within the context of economic, social and environmental domains at the college/university level. He was prepared to understand why faculty who had taught traditional courses often saw the advantage of incorporating Green Chemistry into the courses they teach. What was not as obvious is why students who were encountering chemistry for the first time were often equally passionate about the Green Chemistry movement. Recent attention has been paid, however, to a model that brings clarity to the hitherto vague term of "relevance" that might explain why integrating Green Chemistry into the undergraduate chemistry classroom can achieve a "quadruple bottom-line" for students because of potentially positive effects of adding a domain of "relevance" to the existing economic, social, and environmental domains.

AB In theory, practical work is an established part of university-level chemistry courses. However, mainly due to budget constraints, large class size, time constraints and inadequate teacher preparations, practical activities are frequently left out from chemistry classroom instruction in most developing countries. Small-scale chemistry (SSC) experimentation in which one uses miniature chemical equipment can drastically reduce quantities of chemicals used during experimentation, which can help overcome some of the barriers preventing practical work in the chemistry classroom. This study evaluated the effectiveness of using miniature chemical equipment at the undergraduate level in increasing students' understanding of chemistry concepts as well as in improving their attitude towards chemistry practical work. Two comparable groups of first-year students who enrolled for a Practical General Chemistry course participated. A quasi-experimental design was employed in which the experimental group (N = 49) used the SSC approach while the control group (N = 52) followed the traditional approach for over 8 weeks. Data were gathered using chemistry tests, attitude and perception questionnaires and interviews. Findings showed that the SSC approach was as effective as the traditional laboratory approach in improving students' attitude towards practical work, but more effective in enhancing students' understanding of chemistry concepts. More interestingly, SSC was positively accepted by both students and instructors as an effective strategy for teaching first-year undergraduate chemistry practicals. Some shortcomings of the approach were also identified.

Reformed TA (Teaching assistant) training and allocation method, a thorough course orientation session, text-light/graphics-heavy results PPT reports, and journal article templated-term papers have improved students' satisfaction in the organic chemistry laboratory course. These methods could be implemented while maintaining the traditional organic chemistry laboratory instruction styles and hence could be broadly applicable.

AB Bringing design practices to chemistry education is gaining interest with recent science curriculum reforms emphasising design, and calls for integrated STEM education. Design is a central practice in the chemistry discipline, and could foster meaningful chemistry education. Although chemistry teachers are key in bringing design to chemistry classrooms, and in realising design's potential for learning, little is known about their views on teaching and learning regarding design. To reduce this gap in literature, we explored chemistry teachers' pedagogical ideas in the context of a Dutch professional learning community on design in chemistry education. We elicited teachers' ideas through semi-structured interviews and lesson forms which teachers kept while implementing a design project. Multiple patterns emerged through analysing teachers' ideas. We found that the teachers did not see teaching design as a goal of chemistry education. Instead, teachers valued design as a teaching approach to engage students in applying chemistry concepts, in developing soft skills, and in applying or developing research practices. In this paper, we present more patterns in teachers' ideas, and discuss possible explanations of these findings in depth. Finally, we give suggestions for future research, and teacher professional development that may help support a change to bring design into chemistry education.

AB Green chemistry is the practice of chemistry in a manner that maximizes its benefits while eliminate or at least greatly reduce its adverse impacts. The philosophy of green chemistry principles can imply to the human behavior or character. There were no specific subject to teach character value especially science character value with green chemistry insight. It was integrated in the learning process like in Basic Chemistry subject. Character education has been often associated with behavioral or moral attitude, but actually more and further than it, among others, related to the behavior of nature and the environment. Implementation of green chemistry principles can be adapted in human attitudes and behaviors in an effort to save the environment that can be realized through green education. The aims of this study to determine the feasibility of implementation of science characters value with green chemistry insight by using project based learning (PjBL) model. This research method used pre-experiment design. The results of this research show that the science character value with green chemistry insight feasible done in lectures with PjBL model. The project tasks were done by six groups of students with 6 themes respectively: smart energy, smart water, smart rubbish, smart mobility, and the utilization of renewable feedstock (two themes namely use of natural acid-base indicator, and preparation of perfume from citrus fruit peels). It can be concluded that implementation of green chemistry principles on the science character value with green chemistry insight integrated in Basic Chemistry course by using PjBL in order to realize green education can be done on good category.

AB A historical overview of key events that led, 50 years ago, to the foundation of the European Federation for Medicinal Chemistry (EFMC), and the impact this had on promoting and structuring medicinal chemistry as a discipline in Europe. EFMC, together with the growing number of newly established national medicinal chemistry societies or divisions, created the framework for networking and knowledge exchange. This includes organizing conferences, in particular its biennial 'International Symposium on Medicinal Chemistry (EFMC-ISMC)'. Several interesting trends can be identified from EFMC meetings, EFMC governing bodies, or the federation's recognition of scientific excellence, that highlight changes in the medicinal chemistry community over the last decades, related to affiliation, gender, young scientists, communication tools, and embracing scientific advances.

AB To achieve and safeguard the chemicals management "2020 goal" of least possible adverse effects, we need broad and global transformation to a sustainable chemistry, which can provide the most adequate solutions contributing to sustainable development as set out in the Agenda 2030. As a basis for effective progress, a common understanding is required of sustainable chemistry, of its scope, characteristic elements, and specific objectives, as well are guidelines requisite for influencing the speed and direction of this complex and encompassing transformation. This article aims at stimulating this transition process towards a sustainable chemical sector by proposing "100 words for sustainable chemistry", objectives and guiding principles as well as actions steps towards the further implementation of sustainable chemistry.

AB We describe the implementation and outcomes of an outreach program that spanned three class periods for high school students in Advanced Placement Environmental Science or Chemistry. The outreach activities described herein encompass environmental chemistry, sustainable chemistry, polymer chemistry, materials science, ocean ecology, and computational chemistry. Peer instruction and process-oriented guided inquiry-based learning are used to guide student learning. Through these active learning approaches, students learn the differences in chemical structures of common plastics and how these differences define which plastics readily break down into microplastics in the ocean. A systems thinking approach is used to place the chemistry of plastics into the context of sustainability initiatives, ocean impacts, and the utility of plastic in our everyday lives. Students were given the choice of a laboratory report or a service-learning assignment as a summative assessment. Results of formative assessments, including responses to peer instruction questions, are presented, and considerations for other institutions that may be interested in implementing this material in their courses are discussed.

AB The oxidation chemistry of complex hydrocarbons involves large mechanisms with hundreds or thousands of chemical species and reactions. For practical applications and computational ease, it is desirable to reduce their chemistry. To this end, high-temperature fuel oxidation for large carbon number fuels may be described as comprising two steps, fuel pyrolysis and small species oxidation. Such an approach has recently been adopted as 'hybrid chemistry' or HyChem to handle high-temperature chemistry of jet fuels by utilizing time-series measurements of pyrolysis products. In the approach proposed here, a shallow Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to fit temporal profiles of fuel fragments to directly extract chemical reaction rate information. This information is then correlated with the species concentrations to build an ANN-based model for the fragments' chemistry during the pyrolysis stage. Finally, this model is combined with a C-0-C-4 chemical mechanism to model high-temperature fuel oxidation. This new hybrid chemistry approach is demonstrated using homogeneous chemistry calculations of n-dodecane (n-C12H26) oxidation. The experimental uncertainty is simulated by introducing realistic noise in the data. The comparison shows a good agreement between the proposed ANN hybrid chemistry approach and detailed chemistry results.

DE Augmented Reality; Chemistry
AB Animations and simulations can help understand abstract concepts involved in Chemistry. One of the possibilities with animations and simulations involves adopting Augmented Reality (AR), through which a virtual object is inserted into a real environment.
   In this context, the present work aimed to look at how AR is being adopted in teaching chemistry, to understand Chemistry within the sphere of the microscopic universe. For this purpose, the software that provide life experiences with RA in the sphere of microscopic chemistry were identified, as well as the teaching and learning strategies used.
   A survey of scientific articles was performed for this purpose in the Scielo, Web of Science and Scopus databases, comprising the period from 2000 to 2016. Thirty articles related to Chemistry were found, 7 of them involving AR and microscopic chemistry. Knowledge of AR software used and the strategy to teach and learn Chemistry utilizing them were acquired through documental analysis.
   The details of each of these articles with the software and/or teaching and learning strategy adopted is presented in this article.

This study consists of two parts: In the first part, different economical, institutional and citation parameters were correlated with the number of publications, citations and chemical industry numbers using principal components analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis. The results of the first part indicated that economical and geographical parameters directly affect the chemistry research outcome. In the second part, research in branches of chemistry and related disciplines such as analytical chemistry, polymer science and physical chemistry were analysed using principal components analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis for each country. Publication data were collected as the number of chemistry publications (in Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-E)) between years 2006 and 2016 in different chemistry subdisciplines and related scientific areas. Results of the second part of the study produced geographical and economical clusters of countries, interestingly, without addition of any geographical data.

AB Background: The development of primary pre-service teachers' chemistry motivation and attitudes toward chemistry were examined in order to develop their science literacy using case-based learning. Students' ideas were emphasized, real-life situations were discussed, and students could share their ideas and knowledge with peers; as a result, students were active in the learning process.Purpose: The purpose of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of using case-based learning instruction to increase pre-service primary teachers' chemistry motivation and improve their attitudes toward chemistry as a school subject.Sample: The subjects of this study consisted of 51 (20 female, 31 male) freshman primary pre-service teachers from an urban university in Turkey. The mean age of the primary pre-service teachers was 21.Design and methods: One group pre-test and post-test design was used. A chemistry motivation questionnaire and chemistry attitude scale were used for data collection. For the data analysis, two-way repeated measures of ANOVA and repeated measures MANOVA were conducted.Results: The results indicated that the mean of the attitude score after the treatment was significantly greater than the mean of the attitude before the treatment. The results also demonstrated that there is no significant difference between females and males. According to the results of the study, there is no significant difference between primary pre-service teachers' chemistry motivation. However, some chemistry motivation constructs mean scores are greater after the treatment.Conclusions: In sum, it could be stated that case-based learning is helpful for the development of students' chemistry motivation and attitudes toward chemistry.

AB William Irwin Grayling was a chemical researcher and educator in first Nelson and then Taranaki from the 1850s to 1880s, with particular interests in agricultural chemistry and natural products chemistry. However, he is little known today because of his lack of scientific publications. This short communication explores his chemistry education, together with the context of his chemistry employment here in New Zealand and, prior to that, in New South Wales and South Australia.

DE Nature of chemistry; Creation; Synthesis; Reducibility
AB How do we teach chemistry as a different science from physics? This paper looks into a fundamental distinguishing property of chemistry as a science. It is characterized in this paper that chemistry, unlike many other sciences that are largely descriptive, is primarily creative. In this sense, the various fields of chemistry may seek to create as an end goal, and not merely to create as a means to an end as commonly seen in allied sciences. This distinction is important as it elevates the importance of chemical synthesis above being a small detail of the field. I argue in this paper that synthesis is a largely defining character of chemistry as a structured science, and must be given importance to when attempting to define chemistry as a separate study from similar fields. Awareness of the importance of synthesis can elucidate on the manner and trends of normal chemical research as well as predict possible circumstances that will arise for the field of chemistry.

AB Regular high-school chemistry teachers view gifted students as one of several types of students in a regular (mixed-ability) classroom. Gifted students have a range of unique abilities that characterize their learning process: mostly they differ in three key learning aspects: their faster learning pace, increased depth of understanding, and special interests. If gifted students are to develop their abilities and potential, and learn optimally in a regular classroom, the teaching must be adjusted to meet their special needs. Chemistry high-school curricula have built-in potential to cater to the special needs of gifted students. Chemistry learning entails laboratory work and comprehension of abstract concepts. In the classroom, the interactions between teachers and students are core events that trigger other class events. In the present study the interactions between teachers and gifted students in a regular classroom, which are specific for chemistry teaching, were studied. Two general categories of interactions with gifted students were found to be unique to the chemistry classroom: (1) interactions involving laboratory work and (2) interactions involving the challenge of teaching chemistry content. We found that since gifted students master abstract chemistry concepts quickly and with minimum scaffolding, no interactions regarding this aspect were reported. Gifted students do not need all the instruction time teachers usually devote to explaining abstract concepts in chemistry, concepts that are considered difficult for other students. The present study indicates the essential need of enhancing chemistry teachers' knowledge regarding teaching gifted students in the chemistry classroom. This includes knowledge about how gifted students learn in general, and its adaptation to the chemistry classroom and the chemistry laboratory according to academic and curricular needs of the gifted students.

AB The flow of materials and energy through society is an integral but poorly visible element of global sustainability agendas such as the Planetary Boundaries Framework and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG). Given that the primary activities of chemistry are to analyze, synthesize, and transform matter, the practice of chemistry has a great deal to contribute to sustainability science, which in turn should play an increasingly important role in reshaping the practice of chemistry. Success in integrating sustainability considerations into the practice of chemistry implies a substantial role for chemistry education to better equip students to address the sustainability of earth and societal systems. Building on the framework of the IUPAC Systems Thinking in Chemistry Education (STICE) project, we develop approaches to using systems thinking to educate students about the molecular basis of sustainability, to assist chemistry to contribute meaningfully and visibly toward the attainment of global sustainability agendas. A detailed exemplar shows how ubiquitous coverage in general chemistry courses of the Haber-Bosch process for the synthesis of ammonia could be extended using systems thinking to consider the complex interplay of this industrial process with scientific, societal, and environmental systems. Systems thinking tools such as systems thinking concept map extension (SOCME) visualizations assist in highlighting inputs, outputs, and societal consequences of this large-scale industrial process, including both intended and unintended alterations to the planetary cycle of nitrogenous compounds. Strategies for using systems thinking in chemistry education and addressing the challenges its use may bring to educators and students are discussed, and suggestions are offered for general chemistry instructors using systems thinking to educate about the molecular basis of sustainability.

AB An innovative food laboratory for a chemistry of food and cooking course has been developed for nonscience majors and under-represented students in science. To help these students succeed in science, a laboratory was designed to engage students using food and cooking as a medium for building a stronger foundation in chemistry. Each food laboratory included a chemistry experiment paired with a food preparation that reinforced the chemical principles addressed. The chemistry experiments covered topics that are found in conventional first-year general chemistry courses but instead used food ingredients and kitchen equipment. The food preparations were designed based on chemical concepts that the students learned from the initial chemistry experiments. The food laboratories were found to engage students when chemistry experiments were paired with food preparations. Through this pilot food laboratory we have gained valuable insights into teaching fundamental chemistry to nonscience students.

It is concerned with developing processes and products that reduce or eliminate the use of and generation of hazardous substances. In the 21st century today's students are particularly interested in matters that affect their health and well-being of the planet. To deal with such challenges of students the concept of Green and Sustainable Chemistry not only offers an excellent opportunity to address some of these concerns, but also provides us with a useful way to advance the way we do chemistry. Green chemistry is an ideal focus for undergraduate science education. A strong laboratory component is at the heart of many science courses. In this chapter some of the green chemistry principles and methodologies used to device certain undergraduate laboratory experiments and research are discussed.

AB The creative comparisons prospective chemistry teachers make about "chemistry'' and the "chemist'' may reflect how they perceive these concepts. In this sense, it seems important to determine which creative comparisons prospective teachers make with respect to these and how these can change after the history of chemistry is treated in the classroom. This study seeks to investigate the impact of the basic History and Philosophy of Chemistry course on prospective chemistry teachers' perceptions towards chemistry and the chemist. The study was conducted during the 2012-2013 academic year at a state university in Turkey with 38 prospective chemistry teachers. A creative comparisons questionnaire and semi-structured interviews were used as data collection instruments in the study. This questionnaire was administered to the prospective teachers in the form of a pre-test, post-test, and retention test. Results of the analysis showed that the prospective teachers produced creative comparisons related to chemistry in the pre-test that mostly relied on their own experiences and observations, but that in the post-test and retention test, their comparisons mostly contained references to the role of chemistry in daily life, its development, and its facilitating aspects. Similarly, it was observed that in the pre-test, the prospective teachers made creative comparisons regarding the chemist that related mostly to the laboratory, but that the post-test and retention test rather contained the aspects of chemists as researchers, meticulous persons, facilitators and managers. Also, 18 prospective teachers were engaged in interviews to understand their prior knowledge about chemistry and the chemist, as well as the reasons for the changes in their creative comparisons. The results of the interviews indicated that a large majority of the prospective teachers were able to fully reflect on their inadequacy about their previous knowledge about "chemistry'' and "chemist,'' and it was seen that they could explain the reason they changed their creative comparisons as an outcome of the History and Philosophy of Chemistry course. In the light of these results, it can be said that the History and Philosophy of Chemistry course may help prospective chemistry teachers in their perceptions about both chemistry and the chemist and may add depth to their knowledge.

ID MODEL
AB We incorporated oceanic emissions and atmospheric chemistry of dimethylsulfide (DMS) into the hemispheric Community Multiscale Air Quality model and performed annual model simulations without and with DMS chemistry. The model without DMS chemistry predicts higher concentrations of sulfate (SO42-) over land compared to the low concentrations over seawater. Including DMS chemistry substantially increases (SO42-) concentrations over seawater and many coastal areas. It enhances the annual mean surface (SO42-) by >0.8 mu g/m(3) in some areas of the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Arabian Sea, and Caribbean Sea. The largest enhancement occurs in summer in which DMS chemistry increases surface (SO42-) by 70% over seawater. The model without DMS chemistry underestimates the summer-time observed (SO42-) in the U.S. while the model with DMS chemistry improves model performance in the U.S. coastal areas.

AB Recently, click chemistry has provided important advances in biomedical research fields. Particularly, copper-free click chemistry including strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) and inverseelectron- demand Diels-Alder (iEDDA) reactions enable fast and specific chemical conjugation under aqueous conditions without the need for toxic catalysts. Click chemistry has resulted in a change of paradigm, showing that artificial chemical reactions can occur on cell surfaces, in cell cytosol, or within the body, which is not easy with most other chemical reactions. Click chemistry in vitro allows specific labelling of cellular target proteins and studying of drug target engagement with drug surrogates in live cells. Furthermore, cellular membrane lipids and proteins could be selectively labelled with click chemistry in vitro and cells could be adhered together using click chemistry. Click chemistry in vivo enables efficient and effective molecular imaging and drug delivery for diagnosis and therapy. Click chemistry ex vivo can be used to develop molecular tools to understand tissue development, diagnosis of diseases, and therapeutic monitoring. Overall, the results from research to date suggest that click chemistry has emerged as a valuable tool in biomedical fields as well as in organic chemistry.

AB The study presented here is a follow-up to a previous report in which we investigated how general-chemistry students in a transformed curriculum reason about simple acid base reactions. In the present study, we use and adapt the previously developed coding scheme for a longitudinal study in which we follow students from general chemistry through organic chemistry. We find that (i) generally, the manner in which students reason about acid base reactions increases in sophistication over the course of a two-semester sequence of organic chemistry; (ii) there is little difference in reasoning between students at the end of a transformed general-chemistry course and a similar cohort at the beginning of organic chemistry; (iii) the nature of a student's general-chemistry experience has a profound effect on the sophistication of their reasoning in that students from a transformed general-chemistry course are more likely to provide causal mechanistic explanations for simple acid base reactions than students with other general-chemistry experiences; and (iv) the type of acid base reaction that the students discuss impacts the type of reasoning they exhibit. We find that when asked to explain a Lewis acid base reaction, students are less likely to invoke electrostatic ideas.

AB Air pollution is a major challenge for the humankind Under the highly complex air pollution conditions in China, strong homogenous nucleation and multiphase heterogeneous processes coexist, coupling with strong atmospheric oxidizing capacity and ozone pollution. This complex air pollution, different from the "London smog" and the "Los Angeles photochemical smog", is a new type of " haze chemistry smog" pollution. "Haze chemistry" distinguishes from traditional homogeneous chemistry by surpassing its existing theoretical understandings. It is a type of air pollution chemistry that comprehensively studies the gas-liquid-solid multiphase processes, revealing the formation mechanism of PM2.5 and the non-linear relationship between PM2.5 and O-3 under typical multi-medium complex air pollution conditions. Understanding "haze chemistry" processes is crucial for precise control of complex air pollution in China and other countries. Here, we propose and summarize the concept of "haze chemistry", and discuss its further improvement, development, and application.

AB This work provides a description of our experience with designing and implementing green chemistry elements in higher education. It addresses the problem of content and methodology in green chemistry education and provides models of innovative approaches in design and teaching practices.
   An introductory course, Pollution Prevention, Green Chemistry and Green Engineering, supported by a grant from Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, was designed at Grand Valley State University (GVSU), in Michigan, in 2008 and run for the first time in 2009, with 12 students. The positive response from the students who took the class coupled with increasing visibility of green chemistry initiative at the state level (MI Governor's Green Chemistry directive and Green Chemistry Round Table) led the GVSU administration to recognize the need of such a course and, after revision, to its inclusion into the Chemistry Department curriculum, under the designation "Introduction to green chemistry", CHM 111. This remains to be a sought-after course for freshmen and upper-level undergraduates interested in the issues of green chemistry who have no chemistry background in their education. Since 2011, the course ran twice a year with a total of 302 students to date (December 2017). From semester to semester, it underwent several modifications, in order to accommodate the most recent, up-to-date developments in green chemistry and green engineering. The repository of teaching materials created is growing continuously. The progress and lessons learned throughout the years in running this course are summarized here.

AB The first reception of Mendeleev's periodic table of elements and its first mention and publication in Croatian chemistry textbooks is explored. First recognition of Mendeleev's work can be seen in the Croatian chemical community through the act of Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts which elected Mendeleev as an honorary member (1882). Julije Domac, a pharmacist, a chemist and university professor of pharmacognosy at Zagreb University published his textbook The Inorganic Chemistry for Senior Real-High School Classes (Zagreb, 1901) which is the first textbook written in Croatian language that includes the periodic system table. Gustav Janecek, professor of chemistry at Zagreb University, deserves the most credit for accepting and promoting the periodic system within Croatian chemistry. First university textbook of chemistry in Croatia Chemistry I, General, (Zagreb, 1919), written by Janecek, also includes the periodic table. Croatian scientific community accepted and understood the significance of the Mendeleev's periodic system of elements.

   Content
AB The change in the way of teaching Chemistry requires, among others aspects, the rupture of established teaching practices and involves the professional development of teachers. Several conditions are necessary for such changes to take place, such as the recognition and legitimation of a specific knowledge to teach Chemistry as the Pedagogical Knowledge of Chemistry Content (PCKC) and the identification and characterization of obstacles that hamper the development of this professional knowledge. In this context, this article aims to describe the characterization of two epistemological obstacles: valorative obstacle and experiential obstacle, identified in the concept of undergraduate students of Chemistry Degree. The identification of obstacles of an epistemological nature in the concept of future Chemistry teachers can contribute to the improvement of the teacher training, since it gives subsidies to promote the learning of professional knowledge in Chemistry and perhaps to strengthen the professionalization of this career.

AB This paper describes the development and implementation of GAPc, a gamification project in chemistry. GAPc is an online active student-centered remedial teaching tool allowing prospective and enrolled students to electronically assess their knowledge of basic and advanced chemistry concepts via different game levels of expertise. This provides them with ways to correct potential shortcomings in view of academic education. A large number of exercises with different degrees of difficulty, links to additional sources of information, automated feedback, and the integrated grading center are key features of GAPc. Notwithstanding that GAPc is conceived as a distance learning and self-learning tool, it works equally well in a classroom setting. Indeed, GAPc was initially meant as a trajectory for precollege students to remediate their acquainted knowledge of chemistry by easy remote access. Today, on the Hasselt University Campus, GAPc is used in the chemistry summer school for senior high school students, and in chemistry courses for freshmen and sophomores enrolled in curricula with a major chemistry component.

AB The American Chemical Society's Chemistry Festivals, or "Festivales de Quimica," are community events where chemistry professionals, professors, teachers, and students use hands-on activities to engage the public and demonstrate how chemistry appears in our everyday life. The Chemistry Festival Organizers received training from the ACS, either on an individual basis or as part of larger groups. Several activities chosen by ACS volunteers, which reliably "work well" for engaging visitors during community events, were given. In 2017, the authors held a Chemistry Festival in Bogota, Colombia for Mole Day (Oct. 23, 2017). Fourteen activities were held, where more than 1000 people participated. Participants reported high opinions about each of the activities and gained a more positive attitude toward chemistry after participating in the event. The Chemistry Festival awakens interest in science and its role in our daily lives and also generates enthusiasm and motivation in scholars, students, and other volunteers. This report argues that funds for public hands-on activities are effective to improve people's attitudes toward chemistry and suggests that these kinds of programs should be guaranteed and even expanded.

AB There is a need for more courses that directly address the role business plays in the development of new products and technology. This is particularly true in the areas of green and sustainable chemistry where altruism is often not enough to overcome perceived increased cost. Chemistry of Sustainable Products is an undergraduate chemistry course designed for business students interested in the development of environmentally benign consumer products. It was designed to create more "pull to the market" for greener chemistry and materials by training the next business leaders in some of the foundational science behind safer products. The curriculum fuses introductory courses in general chemistry, material science, and sustainable business. The course utilizes the concept of intermolecular forces as a reoccurring theme to connect the topics of molecular interactions, material properties, toxicity, and product design. In addition to the fusion of business and chemistry, learning objectives for the course emphasize the ability to differentiate between scientific evidence and opinion, and the use of fact-based reasoning in communication. The course structure, rationale, and an initial assessment of learning are presented.

AB Green chemistry education requires learning about the scientific facts of chemistry of the environment and also applying the implications of this knowledge to human lifestyles. All students need to learn how chemistry works as a physical science in its part of the ecological system of our planet. Green chemistry also must be modeled as a lifestyle so that this knowledge can be properly applied. In this chapter, the author describes how various green chemistry topics have been incorporated into the science curriculum at Greenhills School. Furthermore, the author also relates how this knowledge is applied in the school setting so that global sustaining principles can be caught by the next generation of our planet's stewards.

AB Traditional chemistry education is commonly handing down of concepts, principles, and theories, such as mechanical properties, the relationship between structure and properties as well as chemical structure and chemical bonding theory, to students without engaging them in the processes of chemical inquiry. This practice leads to the lack of opportunity for the students to construct an appropriate understanding of these concepts, principles, and theories. Students are also rarely facilitated in modeling the structure and function of matter themselves. This situation shows that the philosophy of chemistry has not received as much attention from chemistry educators. The main idea of this paper is to embed philosophy of chemistry through the implementation of technochemistry in chemistry education. One of the most interesting and rapidly developing areas of modern chemistry, technologies and engineering is Ionic Liquids (ILs) as an emerging knowledge on technochemistry which can be applied to chemistry education. The developments between academic researchers and industrial developments in the ILs area are conducted in parallel. In order to overcome the existing problems of scientific development in chemistry education, the science and technology of ILs can be used for reconceptualizing the teaching and learning of chemistry to embrace the epistemology in chemistry. This study promises a potential contribution by philosophy of chemistry. The main objectives of this study are to develop: (i) a perspective based on philosophy of science considerations (rational reconstruction) in order to understand ionic liquids and (ii) teaching materials that can be used to enhance pre-service teacher's view of nature of science and technology (VNOST). The method used in the study is analytical-descriptive (elementarization), i.e. the first step in the model of educational reconstruction (MER). This study concludes that the development of the concepts and their applications of ionic liquids follow the inductive process. Experimental observations lead to scientific concepts which later can facilitate to elaborate explanatory theories.

AB The ACS Guidelines for bachelor's degrees in chemistry call for the curriculum to include polymer chemistry principles and the synthesis of different classes of macromolecules. Organic chemistry can provide an important introduction to polymer chemistry principles, and photochemically induced radical polymerization is one method for generating polymers that is well suited to be explored in this course. The development and implementation of an experiment for undergraduate organic chemistry laboratory in which students explore both photochemistry and radical chemistry by synthesizing cross-linked polymers via photopolymerization is reported. An inquiry design is used to introduce polymerization reactions, and students learn about air-sensitive lab techniques. Students must pool their data to explain how molecular structure affects the physical properties of a macroscopic material.

AB The challenge in chemistry courses for nonscience majors (such as nursing majors) is not that the students cannot learn chemistry but that they think they cannot learn chemistry. With this in mind, the authors' goal was to create a learning environment in which students would feel motivated to learn and would gain confidence in their ability to learn chemistry. In the one-semester chemistry courses for nursing majors described here, health-related scenarios (such as IV therapy, diabetes, blood chemistry, and brachytherapy) provide context, and POGIL activities provide process and content in a cooperative learning environment. In addition, strategic organization and alignment of learning outcomes helps students to focus on the concepts, principles, and theories that they are expected to learn in a meaningful way. Also essential for the success of this course is a caring yet rigorous instructor who effectively communicates that learning chemistry is difficult but doable. This combination of health-related scenarios, POGIL activities, clear learning outcomes, and a supportive instructor gives students hope that they will succeed in their introductory chemistry course and increases their self-concept in chemistry. Chemistry Self-Concept Inventory data collected during 10 semesters at two different universities show a significant positive increase in our students' chemistry self-concept. Furthermore, Student Assessment of their Learning Gains data collected during the same time period show that students find this learning environment conducive to learning.

AB Sustainable development and sustainability are two widely used umbrella concepts, both "brilliantly ambiguous." Many fields of study, including engineering, business, the humanities, and the sciences offer opportunities for instructors to connect content with sustainability. As the central science, chemistry is surely one of them. This paper issues a call for action to chemistry instructors to build stronger connections in the college chemistry curriculum to the local, regional and global challenges that we face on our planet. These challenges, multi-faceted and multi-disciplinary, include providing clean energy, protecting the environment and stewarding its resources, employing wise agricultural practices to supply food, and insuring clean water and clean air to those in all communities. As a chemical concept, the carbon cycle connects to challenges such as these. It is presented as a possibility for building stronger connections to sustainability in the curriculum.

The implementation of the proposed methodology, which comprises the use of FTIR spectroscopy and quantum chemistry calculations, enables the obtaining of the thermodynamic parameters of the dimerization reaction and their subsequent validation by computational chemistry calculations. Hence, the students are involved in a practical learning scheme focused in the study of a central topic in chemistry, such as hydrogen bonding, with the final purpose being to train chemistry students in applying theoretical-experimental approaches to extract meaningful data and valuable information for explaining experimental observables.

AB This study aims to describe the teachers' perception of Green Chemistry, an area of chemistry that focuses on the design of products and processes that minimize the use and generation of hazardous substances. The description of Green Chemistry is based on the teachers' perception of a Green Chemistry paradigm and how to integrate this perception into the chemistry learning process for their students. The perception and integration of Green Chemistry to achieve sustainable development in the field of chemistry needs to be promoted, especially among educators for spreading to their students. Data were collected by distributing questionnaires to 35 teachers in a Chemical Analyst Vocational School, Makassar, Indonesia. The questionnaire was based on the indicators related to the principles of Green Chemistry including prevention, economic atom, chemical synthesis safe, designing safer chemicals, solvents and compounds safe aides, design for energy efficiency, use of raw materials renewable, stages reduction reactions, use of catalysis, material design decomposition, instantaneous analysis for pollution prevention and chemical which are naturally more secure to prevent accidents. Data were analyzed descriptively to determine the percentage of teachers' perceptions of green chemistry in learning. The results showed that, in general, the majority (97.14%) of teachers at this Indonesian school reported knowledge of Green Chemistry but only 32.30 % were aware of the concept of Green Chemistry. Furthermore, 47.42% of the teachers think that green chemistry does not need to be put into learning curriculum and 31.38% believe need to be included in the learning process. These finding demonstrate that the concept of Green Chemistry has not been socialized among teachers of Chemical Analyst Vocational School of Makassar. For this reason, there is a need for developing a learning model in chemistry teaching that responds to our vision for a sustainable future.

AB Design guidelines for the management of gas-phase and surface chemistry in methane-fueled catalytic micro-combustors were developed. To find out how the interplay between gas-phase and surface chemistry is affected by different operating conditions, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed using a two-dimensional model with detailed chemistry and transport. The effects of feed composition, inlet velocity, combustor dimension, and heat loss were studied to determine the relative role of gas phase and surface chemistry and to understand the important factors controlling chemistry. To delineate the homogeneous-heterogeneous coupling mechanisms, comparisons were made between results for cases where only heterogeneous reactions were allowed, only homogeneous reactions were allowed, and where both mechanisms were allowed. The competition and synergism between gas-phase and surface chemistry were delineated for obtaining design insights. It was shown that the contribution of gas-phase chemistry depends strongly upon the operating conditions; it decreases with decreasing channel size, increasing the heat loss to the surroundings, and the composition away from the stoichiometric point. The crucial factor controlling chemistry is the maximum temperature. To minimize gas-phase chemistry, temperatures should be kept as low as possible in the stable operating regime. Gas-phase chemistry can be either promoted or inhibited by surface chemistry, depending on flow velocity; it can be sustained in catalytic micro-channels (as low as 0.2 mm) well below the quenching distance due to the promoting effect induced by surface heating. Surface chemistry alone can occur under appropriate operating conditions such as compositions, flow velocities, and heat exchange/heat loss rates. Contribution diagrams were constructed and design recommendations were finally made. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Green chemistry can strongly attract students to chemistry. We, therefore, developed a green chemistry educational game that motivates students at the undergraduate and advanced high school levels to consider green chemistry and sustainability concerns as they design a hypothetical, chemical product. The game is intended for incorporation into any chemistry course for majors and non-majors that teaches sustainability and/or the Principles of Green Chemistry at the undergraduate level. The game is free of charge and encourages students to think like professional chemical designers and to develop a chemical product with respect to function and improved human and environmental health. This computer simulation has been assessed by educators and can be seamlessly integrated into an existing curriculum.

The project used assumptions by John Dewey: "learning by doing" and by J. A. Komensky: the principle of visualisation. Older students consolidate the knowledge by teaching younger students in this project. The group elaborated experiments, which they presented to children in a form of artistic performance. The project reveals how an appropriate show, which contain educational elements affects enhancement of perpetuated and acquired knowledge.

AB The application of the methods of machine learning in chemistry is briefly summarized in the present work. We first explain the basic concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Next, the applications in two particular areas are discussed: searching relations between the structure and biological activity of molecules and using the techniques of machine learning in quantum chemistry as well as in other fields of theoretical chemistry. The evolutionary character of the machine learning approaches is emphasized. A fast development is witnessed in the field which, however, gradually follows the previous development in using statistical techniques in chemistry.

AB Many areas in chemistry are interconnected to one another, through which understanding of one area will lead to the comprehension of the other areas. Science, chemistry specifically is an observable field of study. As such, students gain experience in chemistry not only when taught in their classes by their teachers, but also by observations through interaction with their environment. If these experiences are not in line with the scientific truth about a certain concept, they turn to build misconceptions when the new experience is introduced to them. Acid-base chemistry is one of the areas of chemistry that was endowed with a lot of misconceptions. This study determines the conciseness and effectiveness of interactive courseware in overcoming misconceptions in learning acid-based chemistry. Most of the misconceptions generated were been intensified by the instructional strategies, teaching and learning materials used by the teachers. To overcome these misconceptions in acid-base chemistry, the study selected an effective teaching strategy using Needham five phases. It has also gone ahead to develop teaching and learning interactive courseware that will facilitate instructional delivery and overcome those areas of misconceptions in acid-base chemistry. A survey was developed and administered to in-service chemistry teachers of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia and the Sokoto State University of Nigeria. The result obtained indicated that interactive courseware can be concise and effective in overcoming misconception in learning chemistry. It concluded that chemistry teachers should invest in developing courseware to facilitate an understanding of difficult concepts in the subject matter.

AB In this study, we analyzed the causes of decrease in the number of students taking Chemistry ? in the College Scholastics Ability Test (CSAT) by analyzing the adequacy of the Chemistry I question in the CSAT and the recognition survey of students and teachers about the Chemistry I choice. We analyzed some questions in Chemistry I of the CSAT from the year 2014 to 2016. The questions were analyzed to determine whether they were appropriate to the curriculum content, achievement standard, and achievement level. The target of the survey for perception was 452 senior high school students and 68 science teachers. The result of the study showed that the questions in Chemistry I are somewhat difficult compared to the depth and achievement level required by the curriculum, and it also requires mathematical thinking ability. Students recognized the mathematical thinking and complex mathematical skills are needed to solve problems in Chemistry I. Teachers also thought that the choice of Chemistry I is unfavorable in aspect of meeting the minimum academic ability standard, and accordingly, they did not actively recommend students to take Chemistry I. Moreover, most of the teachers recognized that it is necessary to improve the direction of writing questions for Chemistry I. Therefore, setting questions that can be solved using chemical knowledge, not mathematical ability need to be addressed.

AB With Chemistry playing a pivotal role in defining sustainable development, organic chemistry is a key area in which new solvents can be developed and applied to improve known transformations or to discover new ones. Recoverable catalysts are instrumental for accessing effective green synthetic processes and also are a vital tool for modern organic chemistry. Finally, technologies such as flow chemistry can efficiently maximize the efforts towards energy- and waste-minimized synthetic procedures. In this minireview, which is a personal account on the chemistry developed by my group in the last decade, the use of safer/recoverable solvents, heterogeneous catalysis, and flow reactors are presented as interlocked tools for accessing a green organic chemistry.

AB Past research has demonstrated that the math component of the SAT correlates with exam scores and course grades in undergraduate chemistry courses. This chapter explores the effect of students' math abilities on their achievement in chemistry and the mediating role of math self-beliefs underlying this process. Using data from student responses to the Attitudes Toward Mathematics Inventory and exam outcomes from preparatory and general chemistry courses, this chapter first characterizes students' math self-beliefs reported at the beginning of the term. Then, the relationship between math self-beliefs and chemistry achievement is explored using structural equation modeling. Specifically, we examine the extent to which the math ability chemistry achievement relationship is mediated, if at all, by math self-beliefs. Implications for future research and teaching addressing mathematical reasoning in chemistry are discussed in light of self-belief theories.

AB Development of chemistry curriculum for lower-secondary education system in Czechia since 1989 has not been mapped yet. Nevertheless, this curriculum represents the fundamentals of chemistry education and thus affects students' future progress. In this paper, changes in educational programmes focused on chemistry, its educational objectives, subject matter and hourly dotation are analysed. This information is also completed with an overview of chemistry textbooks approved in accordance with a valid educational programme in periods under discussion. Altogether, six educational programmes and ten sets of textbooks which are still being used in the schools in Czechia are introduced. The changes of curricular framework and subsequent documents reflect development of student education and conditions of lower-secondary teachers' work. This information may serve as a basis for chemistry education research and also contemporary curricular reform.

AB Despite advances in active learning pedagogy and other methods designed to increase student engagement in the chemistry classroom, retention and engagement issues still persist, particularly with respect to women and minorities underrepresented in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) programs. Relevancy also remains elusive in the chemistry classroom, where real-world issues of social justice, health, and the environment are largely missing from chemistry curricula. As a result, students struggle to understand their role as change agents and global citizens with leadership responsibility toward developing solutions to these justice issues, particularly as they relate to chemistry and manufacturing industries. Green chemistry curriculum developed by groups such as the Molecular Design Research Network, Beyond Benign, Greener Education Materials for Chemists, and others is available for faculty to seamlessly integrate topics of social, health, and environmental justice problem-solving into their classes, with a focus on educating future chemists who recognize their role in solving (or preventing) global justice issues. The purpose of this paper is to share new instructional strategies needed to add relevancy to the life of chemistry students.

AB The Enthalpy and Entropy in Dissolution and Precipitation Inventory (E2DPI) has been developed to measure student understanding of the dissolution of ionic solutes, aqueous precipitation reactions, and the enthalpy and entropy changes that accompany these processes. The E2DPI was designed using a mixed-methods protocol, such that the questions on the instrument were grounded in the reasoning and explanations offered during the semi-structured interviews with general chemistry and physical chemistry students. The concept inventory was administered to general chemistry (n = 383), physical chemistry (n = 10), and biophysical chemistry students (n = 43) at one institution. The inventory was also administered at a second institution to students in a postorganic General Chemistry II course (n = 160). The validity and reliability of the data generated from the E2DPI were assessed using both qualitative - and quantitative data. Some of the misconceptions assessed by the instrument and data indicating the prevalence of these ideas are presented.

AB The impact of polymeric materials on the well-being of citizens of the modern world is enormous. These materials enhance virtually every facet of life-from clothing and personal care items to housing and transportation. Yet despite this, and the fact that most chemists work in a polymer or polymer-related area, polymeric materials have traditionally gotten scant attention in the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. This is now beginning to change. The American Chemical Society now recognizes that undergraduate training in chemistry without inclusion of polymeric materials is inadequate. Inclusion of polymeric materials enhances the curriculum in several ways. It serves to generate student awareness, to create enthusiasm for chemistry, to promote good student performance, and to provide a sound basis for future career development.

AB Community colleges educate nearly half of all students who complete postsecondary degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. For many matriculated students, chemistry is a required gatekeeping course for postsecondary retention and advancement in STEM majors. This research explored community college student enrollment and performance in introductory chemistry courses for STEM majors, and how chemistry achievement related to student background characteristics and degree persistence. Data included grades, demographics, enrollment patterns, and degree status for 1,690 chemistry students who matriculated at a diverse, suburban community college from 2011 to 2014. Descriptive statistics indicated 32% of students received grades of D, F, or W in introductory chemistry; 49% of these students changed their majors after taking the course, with four-fifths of those degree changers switching to non-STEM fields. Binary logistic regression models revealed that chemistry enrollment was a significant predictor of degree change to non-STEM disciplines, with biology and anatomy/physiology coursetaking predicting STEM persistence. Degree change to non-STEM was predicted by chemistry performance but not by student characteristics including gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The results indicate that chemistry coursetaking and performance are notable factors affecting student persistence in STEM disciplines, and achievement is largely independent of student background variables. Implications for community college chemistry teaching and STEM academic advisement are discussed.

AB The advent of bioorthogonal chemistry has led to the development of powerful chemical tools that enable increasingly ambitious applications. In particular, these tools have made it possible to achieve what is considered to be the holy grail of many researchers involved in chemical biology: to perform unnatural chemical reactions within living organisms. In this minireview, we present an update of bioorthogonal reactions that have been carried out in animals for various applications. We outline the advances made in the understanding of fundamental biological processes, and the development of innovative imaging and therapeutic strategies using bioorthogonal chemistry.

AB The purpose of this study was to analyze chemistry textbooks and teachers' guidebooks from the perspective of 'Ignorance', one of the important features of model. This is because the emphasis is on developing modeling capabilities for students in the 2015 Revised Curriculum. For this, Arrhenius model and Bronsted-Lowry model were selected as acid and base models in neutralization reaction which are important contents in chemistry curriculum. The analysis criteria of this study were extracted by analyzing previous studies and four general chemistry textbooks dealing with 'Ignorance' related to acid and base neutralization reaction. Based on the analysis criteria, we analyzed nine chemistry I textbooks and teacher's guides and six chemistry II textbooks and teacher's guides of the 2015 revised curriculum. In addition, we analyzed contents of four chemistry I textbooks and teacher's guides and three chemistry II textbooks and teacher`s guides in the 2009 revised curriculum for comparison according to revised curriculums. We analyzed the contents related to the concept of 'neutralization reaction', 'neutrality', 'quantitative relation of neutralization reaction', 'degree of ionization', and 'ionization constant'. Based on the results of this study, we proposed a way to present 'Ignorance' of the models in teachers' guidebooks that chemistry teachers can understand 'Ignorance' of model and teach modeling capabilities for students.

AB Professor Fran Bubanovic was the founder of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at School of Medicine established a hundred years ago, in 1917, within the University of Zagreb. Fran Bubanovic was an exemplary scientist, great science communicator and teacher. He trained many generations of physicians in chemistry and biochemistry. The aim of this essay is to give insight into his scientific collaboration with the Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius and other world-renowned scientists, his teaching work in chemistry, his university textbooks in the field of medical chemistry and biochemistry since he had a profound impact on education of medical students in basic science. We hope that this essay will bring an additional dimension of Fran Bubanovic as a superb university teacher and scientist whose legacy still remains unequalled. Therefore, he is legitimately called "the father of medical chemistry" in Croatia.

AB We have successfully developed a one-semester general chemistry course that meets the primary learning goals of the traditional two-semester sequence. It is appropriate for physical, life, and earth science majors. Since implementation, 88% of students who start general chemistry complete it, an increase from 72% in our prior traditional curriculum. Scores on a full-year ACS general chemistry exam are almost the same, as are attitudes as measured by the CLASS-Chemistry instrument. Thus, one-semester general chemistry is more efficient, allowing students to move on to additional STEM courses quicker without impacting learning of core content. By increasing completion rates through general chemistry, we have removed a key barrier for students majoring in STEM fields. As well, students now can proceed through organic chemistry and biochemistry by the end of their second year, consistent with the increased emphasis on the chemistry of biological systems for the life sciences and in admissions to medical school. This reform can be implemented by schools that value the traditional quantitative and broad content of general chemistry without modifying later courses or disrupting other departments.

AB Purpose This paper aims to investigate the knowledge, attitude and behaviour of foundation chemistry learners concerning the sustainable development concept. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative and quantitative studies were conducted. Atlas.ti software was used to analyse the chemistry curriculum based on selected themes and sub-themes. A survey was carried out involving 132 chemistry learners. The chemistry learners were students from a foundation programme in a local university located in Selangor, Malaysia. The collected data were analysed using SPSS 21.0 involving descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings Document analysis on the chemistry curriculum shows that water is the theme most covered in the chemistry learners' textbook, as compared to other themes. In general, the chemistry learners have good knowledge and attitude concerning the sustainable development concept. However, their knowledge and attitude do not reflect in their behaviour as an individual, as well as in the classroom. Moreover, their knowledge, attitude and behaviour focus more on environmental dimension, as compared to other sustainable development dimensions. Practical implications This paper is instrumental in assisting educators to assess how chemistry learners perceive sustainable development, and this may help to bring about changes to improve chemistry teaching and learning processes towards education for sustainable development. Originality/value This paper is an original and novel research paper which is first conducted on sustainable development concept in chemistry curriculum in Malaysia.

ID ASSESSING KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION
AB Traditionally, university students struggle with physical chemistry courses at Faculty of Science. This is particularly evident in the mutual integration of knowledge in general chemistry, physics, and mathematics that are considered as fundamental to physical chemistry. This paper presents the results of research conducted with the 2nd year chemistry students at the Faculty of Science University of Sarajevo, with the main aim to find solutions to these difficulties that could lead to greater learning efficiency, and a successful continuation of their chemistry studies. The results indicated that students' knowledge of concepts relevant to physical chemistry is not at a satisfactory level. This is in line with the rather low students' grades in general chemistry, general physics and mathematics during the first year of the study. Students reported their most common difficulties: the lack of time for learning, the lack of literature recommended by the syllabus, and certain mathematical concepts they do not understand. To overcome them, it is important to direct students to use the available resources more efficiently, and to emphasize the significance of knowledge integration.

AB The sophomore organic chemistry sequence (Organic I and II) has a reputation: one that has prospective students worried. Their anxiety is well-founded, given estimates of the national success rate (defined as a grade of "C" or better) of 50-75%. In an attempt to improve both student success and student opinions about chemistry, we implemented a one-week "boot camp" (preparatory) course that we called Preparing for Organic Chemistry. This course reviewed the concepts of general chemistry required for success in Organic Chemistry I and II. We found improvements in student opinion of Organic Chemistry I (both before starting and after taking the course). Further, we have found that the boot camp had a measurable and statistically significant impact on student success rates.

AB The use of online collaborative assignments (OCAs) between two flipped organic chemistry classrooms, one in Canada and the other in the United States, was examined for impact on learners. The intervention was designed to support content mastery, aid in increasing students' communication skills through chemistry drawing and verbalization, facilitate emergence of professional identity, and promote development of appreciation for chemistry as an international language. A mixed-methods approach consisting of interviews, student written reflections, and questionnaires was used to evaluate the impact of the OCAs. Students described their experience of the OCAs in terms of: chemistry communication confidence; engaged learning; chemistry learning; relationships; and professional identity.

AB The skills and knowledge of the employers of chemists have been explored in varying degrees of specificity. Some studies have argued that the current university curriculum does not prepare students for modern industry adequately, while others have provided an overview of the job market for graduates with a bachelors degree in chemistry. In order to stay relevant, the chemistry undergraduate course syllabi need to evolve constantly to meet the needs of the modern-day chemist. This study examines the specific technical skills and knowledge in job advertisements required by graduates with a bachelors degree in chemistry to successfully transition to a workplace. A relatively new initiative in the chemistry department of the National University of Singapore, namely, the final year internship program, is also evaluated in this paper. Additionally, the chemistry undergraduate course syllabi of the universities and the most researched chemistry topics are examined. The aim of this study is to bridge the gap between chemistry departments and industries or research institutes.

AB Radical chemistry is tightly interwoven in proposed prebiotic synthetic pathways, reaction networks and geochemical scenarios that have helped shape our understanding of how life could have originated. Gasphase prebiotic reactions involving electric discharge, vapour ablation by asteroidal and cometary impacts as well as ionising radiation all produce radicals that facilitate complex molecular synthesis. Reactions in the solid phase which are responsible for astrochemical syntheses can also take place through radicals produced via irradiation of protoplanetary/interstellar ice grains and dust particles. Aqueous-phase radical chemistry affords further molecular complexity promoting the production of precursors for the synthesis of biopolymers thought important for the emergence of life. Radical chemistry appears to be a common thread amongst all kinds of prebiotic investigations, and this Review aims to bring attention to a few selected examples. Some important historical studies and modern developments with respect to prebiotic chemistry are summarised through the lens of radical chemistry.

AB The synthesis of substituted 1,4-benzoquinones, a biologically important class of compounds, was developed using mu-oxodi(phenyliodanyl) diacetate, a (diacetoxyiodo)benzene-based oxidizing reagent, in order to introduce second-year undergraduate organic laboratory students in their second semester or advanced organic students to increasingly popular and environmentally friendly hypervalent iodine chemistry. This experiment develops on concepts found in the undergraduate organic chemistry curriculum; conveniently fits into approximately two 3 h lab modules; and utilizes regularly found equipment and inexpensive, commercially available chemicals.

AB First commercialized in the second half of the 1990s as organosilica-entrapped lipases, sol-gel catalysts share several unique properties that make them ideally suited for process chemistry, namely synthetic organic chemistry in the fine chemicals industry. Is their application potential fully realized? What are the obstacles to their widespread uptake in the specialty and fine chemicals industry? Can they also be employed in visible-light photocatalysis?

AB Analysis of recent publications in Green Analytical Chemistry shows the current trends and future needs in this area. The main issues are related to search for cheaper, more efficient, more accurate, greener and miniaturized alternatives. Miniaturization is perhaps, the most notable current trend in analytical chemistry. Rapid developments and improvements in instrumentation have led to an impressive range of benchtop technology and portable devices. In addition, an important issue that has been explored by many authors is metrics of Green Analytical Chemistry, such as Analytical Eco-Scale or Green Analytical Procedure Index. Implementation of interdisciplinary methods is an emerging trend in Green Analytical Chemistry. Employment of multicriteria decision analysis, a technique which is used in environmental management, to Green Analytical Chemistry is a very popular and common trend. Another important issue that will determine the future of Green Analytical Chemistry is education and popularization of this concept in the society. This chapter summarizes contemporary problems and gives the future perspectives of Green Analytical Chemistry.

AB Conjugation chemistry is one of the main parameters affecting immunogenicity of glycoconjugate vaccines and a rational approach toward a deeper understanding of their mechanism of action will greatly benefit from highly-defined and well-characterized structures. Herein, different conjugation methods were investigated with the aim of controlling glycosylation site and glycosylation density on the carrier protein.S.Typhimurium lipopolysaccharide O-Antigen and CRM(197)carrier protein were used as models. In particular, thiol and click chemistry were examined, both involving the linkage of the terminal reducing sugar unit of the O-Antigen chain to different amino acids on the carrier protein. Thiol chemistry allowed O-Antigen conjugation only when the carrier protein was activated on the lysines and with a relative high number of linkers, while click chemistry allowed conjugate generation even when just one position on the protein was activated and to both lysine and tyrosine sites. The study highlights click chemistry as a leading approach for the synthesis of well-defined glycoconjugates, useful to investigate the relationship between conjugate design and immune response.

AB As one approach to moving beyond transmitting "inert" ideas to chemistry students, we use the term "teaching from rich contexts" to describe implementations of case studies or context-based learning based on systems thinking that provide deep and rich opportunities for learning crosscutting concepts through contexts. This approach nurtures the use of higher-order cognitive skills to connect concepts and apply the knowledge gained to new contexts. We describe the approach used to design a set of resources that model how rich contexts can be used to facilitate learning of general chemistry topics. The Visualizing the Chemistry of Climate Change (VC3) initiative provides an exemplar for introducing students in general chemistry courses to a set of core chemistry concepts, while infusing rich contexts drawn from sustainability science literacy. Climate change, one defining sustainability challenges of our century, with deep and broad connections to chemistry curriculum and crosscutting concepts, was selected as a rich context to introduce four topics (isotopes, acids bases, gases, and thermochemistry) into undergraduate general chemistry courses. The creation and assessment of VC3 resources for general chemistry was implemented in seven steps: (i) mapping the correlation between climate literacy principles and core first-year university chemistry content, (ii) documenting underlying science conceptions, (iii) developing an inventory of chemistry concepts related to climate change and validating instruments that make use of the inventory to assess understanding, (iv) articulating learning outcomes for each topic, (v) developing and testing peer-reviewed interactive digital learning objects related to climate literacy principles with particular relevance to undergraduate chemistry, (vi) piloting the materials with first-year students and measuring the change in student understanding of both chemistry and climate Science concepts, and (vii) disseminating the interactive resources for use by chemistry educators and students. A novel feature of the approach was to design resources (step v) based on tripartite sets of learning outcomes (step iv) for each chemistry and climate concept, with each knowledge outcome accompanied by an outcome describing the evidential basis for that knowledge, and a third outcome highlighting the relevance of that knowledge for students.

AB Flow chemistry is a continually emerging and ever-growing area of synthetic organic chemistry. It provides an orthogonal approach to traditional batch chemistry, oftentimes allowing for more efficient routes to desired target molecules. It is generally accepted that flow chemistry offers a valuable change to the process landscape. From a process perspective, there are many advantages associated with flow chemistry over traditional batch chemistry, the most prominent of which is an increased safety profile with the use of highly reactive chemical species, such as organolithiums. These reagents are highly valuable species for the efficient synthesis of pharmaceutical intermediates. Disadvantageously, use of these reagents on commercial scale is severely hindered by the highly energetic nature of the reaction intermediates and their concomitant safety risk. Flow chemistry provides a viable platform for use of these reagents, offering a high degree of control over reaction parameters. In this review, we present a comprehensive account of the published literature implementing the use of organolithium reagents as strong bases for deprotonation reactions in flow systems.

AB Introductory chemistry courses are required as part of the undergraduate preparation necessary for entry into an array of professional programs. Given the varied priorities of the student population in these courses, it can be difficult to present the material such that students see their individual future academic priorities represented in each course. At St. Louis College of Pharmacy, introductory chemistry classes serve a singular population with a declared interest in pursuing further education in the professional pharmacy curriculum. As part of a campus-wide prepharmacy curriculum restructure, the chemistry curriculum was redesigned to take advantage of this focused audience. The result is a new, four semester Threaded Curriculum that merges topics taught in general and organic chemistry with filtering for relevance to prepharmacy. To compare student performance in the new curriculum to the traditional, students were evaluated on 245 common multiple choice exam items as the relevant topics were covered in each course of the curriculum. Initially, traditional curriculum students outperformed the Threaded Curriculum students in first semester organic topics, but both groups scored the same average on the ACS Organic Chemistry End of Year exam. This occurred even though Threaded Curriculum students had only three semesters of chemistry preparation at the time of the exam. Furthermore, Threaded Curriculum students surpassed the national average on the ACS General Chemistry End of Year exam at the fourth semester. This indicates that students can be taught chemistry by providing more relevant topics for their future while still ensuring that students are meeting content goals reflected in standardized chemistry exams.

AB We argue that chemistry should be the next grand challenge for Artificial Intelligence. The AI research community and humanity would benefit tremendously from focusing AI research on chemistry on a regular basis, as a benchmark as well as a real-world application domain. To support our position, we review the importance of chemical compound discovery and synthesis planning and discuss the properties of search spaces in a chemistry problem. Knowledge acquired in domains such as two-player board games or single-player puzzles places the AI community in a good position to solve critical problems in the chemistry domain. Yet, we show that searching in chemistry problems poses significant additional challenges that will have to be addressed. Finally, we envision how several AI areas like Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, planning and search, are relevant for chemistry.

AB Fundamentally concerned with motivation, self-determination theory (SDT) represents a framework of several mini-theories to explore how social context interacts with people's motivational types categorized by degree of regulation internalization. This paper aims to modify an existing theory-based instrument (Academic Motivation Scale, or AMS) and provide validity evidence for the modified instrument (Academic Motivation Scale-Chemistry) as a measure of seven types of student motivation toward chemistry. The paper explores how motivation as measured by AMS-Chemistry is related to student academic achievement and attendance. In a pilot study, the unmodified AMS showed good reliability, reasonable data fit, and the ability to detect motivational differences by sex in college chemistry courses. Based on the pilot study results, expert panel discussions, and cognitive interviews with students, the Academic Motivation Scale - Chemistry (AMS-Chemistry) was developed. AMS-Chemistry was administered to university students in a first semester general chemistry course twice within a semester. An examination of validity evidence suggested that the AMS-Chemistry data could be used to investigate student motivation toward chemistry. Results showed students were extrinsically motivated toward chemistry on average, and there was an overall motivational difference favoring males with a medium effect size. Correlation studies showed motivation was not associated with academic achievement at the beginning of the term, but intrinsic motivation subscales (to know, to experience, and to accomplish) were positively associated with academic achievement at the end of the term. Results also showed that students who persisted in class attendance scored higher on intrinsic motivation subscales than those who did not persist. The 28-item AMS-Chemistry is easy to administer and can be used to better understand students' motivation status and how it might change across the curriculum. Faculty interested in promoting student intrinsic motivation may also use the AMS-Chemistry to evaluate the impact of their efforts.

AB We report a series of experiments based upon cinnamon oil that were developed to provide a practical integration of green and sustainable chemistry concepts for the organic chemistry laboratory. Five experiments centering around cinnamaldehyde as a green, plant-based chemical were performed by undergraduate students in a second-year organic chemistry class. Cinnamon oil was obtained through hydro-distillation, and cinnamaldehyde was used to demonstrate the use of a secondary metabolite in chemistry laboratories. Subsequently, a reduction reaction, aldol reaction, and Schiff base formation were carried out. Through these experiments, students are able to practice techniques such as thin-layer chromatography, column chromatography, recrystallization, and measurement of melting points along with UV, FTIR, and H-1 NMR spectroscopy. Microscale practices were employed in each of the reactions, and microscale column chromatography was used for purifications. The final experiment was an antimicrobial activity assessment of cinnamon oil and the cinnamaldehyde derivatives obtained from the previous experiments. Along with an interdisciplinary component, students were exposed to sunscreen chemistry and were led to consider the many uses of each product obtained. These experiments were based upon a single, inexpensive plant metabolite and biobased material to educate students about green chemistry and its practical applications in the undergraduate laboratory.

DE Green chemistry; Green solvents; Catalysts; Chemical wastes
ID CATALYSTS; TRENDS
AB Green chemistry or sustainable chemistry focuses on designing products and processes that minimize the generation or use of hazardous substances. Green chemistry, though not a new area, has recently gained much importance because of increasing environmental concerns. Industries now focus on adopting processes which are mainly non-hazardous, easier to undertake, lesser energy and time consuming, using re-usable reagents, degeneration of drastic materials, and more economical. These concepts have identified and developed various technologies such as microwave, ultrasonic, UV radiation, electrochemistry, etc., as green technologies. Solvents such as water, has significant importance, being non-hazardous, easily recoverable, and lowering unnecessary wastage of energy. Other recoverable solvents such as acetone, alcohol, methanol, etc., come under green chemicals. Catalysts that promote chemical reactions, without causing hazardous effect and are recoverable are also a part of green chemistry. All the aspects of green chemistry, improving the level of research in chemistry and advance techniques make the experimental work easier to new researchers. This is a positive and harmless growth in the field of chemistry.

ID PANPSYCHISM
AB Any panpsychism building complex consciousness out of basic atoms of consciousness needs a theory of mental chemistry' explaining how this building works. This paper argues that split-brain patients show actual mental chemistry or at least give reasons for thinking it possible. The paper next develops constraints on theories of mental chemistry. It then puts forward models satisfying these constraints. The paper understands mental chemistry as a transformation consistent with conservation of consciousness rather than an aggregation perhaps followed by the creation of something in addition. The paper suggests that this kind of mental chemistry alone yields a workable panpsychism.

   General chemistry
ID MOLECULAR-BASIS; EDUCATION
AB Introductory college chemistry courses are required by a wide range of science curricula. This fact has tended to frame the courses as places where core, fundamental ideas are taught, so that a foundation of knowledge might be called upon by students when they are in subsequent courses. Unfortunately, the preponderance of com- partmentalized fundamental topics bolsters learning that has challenges in terms of transfer of knowledge to other science settings. One method that has been proposed to help alleviate this concern is to incorporate systems thinking and rich contexts that directly connect foundational chemistry ideas to larger systems. One area that shows strong potential for such efforts is the science of pharmaceuticals. Adding examples related to the chemistry of drugs, both within the large lecture setting of general chemistry and within smaller discussion groups. The role of example problems, student writing projects and group construction of systems thinking related visualizations of the context of pharmaceutical chemistry are reported.

The presented information itself is important in historical point of view; however, we believe, that it plays an equally significant role in the chemistry teaching process as well. Linking different chemical issues to the history of its discovery or development kindles additional interest and disposition in students. Once the mood is created, it never fades away and in the future, a good basis is ensured for comprehensive learning of the topic.

AB In this work, a hydrazone chemistry assisted DNAzyme has been designed and constructed. The introduction of hydrazone chemistry increases the versatility of DNAzymes. With superior catalytic capability, the hydrazone chemistry assisted DNAzyme has been successfully applied for the analysis of double targets. Taking 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as samples, the hydrazone chemistry assisted DNAzyme can be used for the detection of different combinations of targets. Moreover, because hydrazone chemistry is popular in nature, this work may also provide a new insight for the development of DNAzymes and their multifunctionality.

AB Electric utilities are faced with a shortage of skilled personnel in the coming years due to normal retirements, early retirements, and plant closings. This is true in chemistry departments as well as other departments.
   There are many aspects to succession planning to successfully fill the upcoming vacancies. For chemistry departments one important tool is to develop comprehensive written plans for chemical control of the systems impacted by chemistry. These plans can be termed control plans or strategic plans. The chemistry plans should be developed for several individual plant systems, including boiler cycle chemistry, open cooling water, closed cooling water, makeup treatment systems, glycol systems, and wastewater treatment systems, among others.
   Another very important tool is the comprehensive chemistry data acquisition system a collection of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) nodes at each generating station, accompanied by a combined web-based management system overview. These systems are vital in monitoring all the process chemistry systems explained in the aforementioned control/strategic plans.
   This paper describes the development and content of control/strategic plans for chemistry control in these various systems as well as several other succession planning items.

ID EDUCATION
AB The purpose of this research is to examine the effect of microteaching on teaching experiences of pre-service chemistry teachers. The research which was a one-group pretest-posttest design study was conducted with 31 pre-service chemistry teachers in a state university in Turkey in 2009-2010 fall semesters. The data of the research was collected by using self-evaluation, group evaluation, peer-evaluation, researchers' evaluations, observer evaluation together with students' self-reflective essays and feedback forms. The data obtained from this study shows that pre-service chemistry teachers lack skills related to teaching experience before applying microteaching. Also the results of this study show that microteaching contributed to the development of communication skills performance, illustrated talk performance, and process skill lesson performance of the pre-service teachers. Moreover, pre-service chemistry teachers realized the deficiencies in their chemistry teaching practices and overcame them, emphasized the relationship between chemistry and daily life more, became more aware of students' misconceptions about chemistry topics due to the microteaching technique.

AB In the field of organic synthesis, the advent of flow chemistry and flow microreactor technology represented a tremendous novelty in the way of thinking and performing chemical reactions, opening the doors to poorly explored or even impossible transformations using batch methods. In this Concept article, we would like to highlight the impact of flow chemistry for exploiting highly reactive organometallic reagents, and how, alongside the well-known advantages concerning safety, scalability, and productivity, flow chemistry makes possible processes that are impossible to control by using the traditional batch approach.

AB The practice and research on online chemistry education have received great attention in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. This paper describes the teaching practice of online learning based on three online courses for pre-service chemistry teachers. To adapt online teaching requirements, we reshaped the structure of the physical chemistry course, for example, adjusting the assessment approaches, and reinforcing long-distance instruction. Besides, we also shared the course of training chemistry teaching skills online publicly, and provided multiple learning approaches after class. Moreover, we introduced chemistry education research based on website data in an educational research methods course and shared ideas through the technology platform.

AB The primary activities of chemistry involve analysing, synthesizing and transforming matter, yet insufficient attention has been paid to the implications of those activities for human and environmental well-being. Since a core element of addressing sustainability challenges requires attention to the material basis of society, a new paradigm for the practice of chemistry is needed. Chemistry education, especially gateway post-secondary general chemistry courses, should be guided by an understanding of the molecular basis of sustainability. A Systems Thinking in Chemistry Education framework illustrates one way to integrate knowledge about the molecular world with the sustainability of Earth and societal systems.

AB This work analyzes the student's conception of a good chemistry teacher and a good chemistry class. The methodological approach adopted in this work is based on the principles of a qualitative research. The student's voice was captured by an open questionnaire applied in the Technical course in Chemistry, integrated modality of the Federal South Rio-Grandense Institute, Campus Pelotas. In order to contribute to the training and teaching practices that have been adopted in our schools, we ask to the students characteristics that they attribute to a good teacher and a good chemistry class. As a result, we can see that a good chemistry teacher, in the student's voice, is multidimensional and involves, at the same time, characteristics related to didactics and affectivity.

AB Increased awareness on a critical association between the natural environment and human development gave rise multiple projects, aiming to protect the natural environment and to preserve it for future generations. Chemists must be acquainted with the principles of green chemistry and the need to practice experimental chemistry with cleaner chemical reactions and sustainability. This is a major concern for all the educators forming new professionals within the Chemistry, Pharmacology and Biology curricula in the Faculty for Higher Studies Zaragoza from the National Autonomous University of Mexico. With this in mind, we start our teachings explaining from the very beginning, how important it is to perform microscale techniques and to follow the principles of green chemistry in the Basic Science Laboratory. Furthermore, we have modified, designed and evaluated working procedures related with chemical synthesis, kinetics and calorimetry. By doing this, we managed to greatly reduce the amount of reagents required and residues generated. Some laboratory reagents have been substituted with renewable substances. We have also included in our programme a regular treatment of residues generated during everyday laboratory work. Our goal is to emphasize the importance of minimizing the environmental impact of chemistry and to prepare environmentally concerned professionals who keep sustainability as main priority and perform chemistry procedures with good laboratory practice routines.

AB In the present work, I analyze the structuralist reconstructions of Quantum Mechanics that Hettema provides in the light of the problem of the reduction of Chemistry to quantum mechanics through Quantum Chemistry. The goal is to show that those reconstructions operate as a counter-argument to the reductionist position since, actually, they do not reconstruct all quantum mechanics, but a "modified" quantum mechanics for the purposes of Chemistry. Finally, I highlight the role that this reconstruction of Quantum Mechanics plays in the discussions about the inter-theoretical links between Chemistry and Physics.

AB The 'Gibbs Diagram' represents some of the key processes controlling surface water chemistry. This review highlights that the processes listed on the Gibbs Diagram may not be applicable for assessing processes controlling groundwater chemistry. We discuss the importance of geochemical processes governing groundwater chemistry in the Gibbs Diagram framework. We show that the processes represented on the Gibbs Diagram-originally developed for surface waters-are unlikely to represent key processes controlling the chemistry of most groundwater systems.

AB A thought-provoking activity called the "Chemistry Connections Challenge" (CCC) has been introduced to an introductory organic chemistry course as a method of highlighting the real-world applications of course content. Identifying how course material can be utilized in the world around them may be difficult for students in introductory organic chemistry courses, particularly those geared toward life science disciplines. This activity was created as a means to improve student attitudes toward organic chemistry by encouraging them to explore how course content is applied to nature, research, and everyday life. In preparation for the activity, students are exposed to several instructor-generated "Chemistry Connections" slides shown in class during the first 4 weeks of the semester. Then, students are invited to create their own slide as part of the "Chemistry Connections Challenge" activity. As students complete the activity they engage with the course material in a meaningful way which can stimulate new ways of thinking about organic chemistry, identify the value of course content, and improve the overall learning process. This simple activity can be a valuable part of any chemistry course, as it can easily be applied in a variety of class sizes, and is suitable for students with diverse educational backgrounds and goals.

AB This study investigates how students account for a macroscopic temperature change during the dissolution of ionic salts through particulate level explanations. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with general chemistry, physical chemistry, and biophysical chemistry students. During the interviews, students conducted hands-on tasks that induded the touching of beakers containing exothermic or endothermic dissolution processes. Data analysis resulted in categorizing students into groups based on their ideas about bond breaking, bond making, and energy changes. Students' particulate understandings of the dissolving process did not appear to impact their explanations of the energy changes they observed. Only two students (one from general chemistry and one from biophysical chemistry) correctly described both the dissolving process and the macroscopic energy changes. No students invoked the concepts of potential energy, lattice energy, or enthalpy of hydration to explain their observations.

AB Rapid development in the field of reticular chemistry has allowed scientists ever-increasing control over the design and synthesis of crystalline porous materials. The promise that this field has in the development of next generation materials for numerous applications (gas storage and separation, catalysis, chemical sensing, electronics) relies on the effective training of new scientists in the diverse array of computational, synthetic, and analytical techniques that reticular chemistry requires. Herein, we describe a laboratory research experience designed to equip a class of upper-division undergraduates in chemistry and chemical engineering not only with these skills but also the skills necessary to communicate their future research accomplishments to the greater scientific community. The course is subdivided into three modules: (i) synthesis, characterization, and post-synthetic modification of metal-organic frameworks; (ii) superacid catalysis with metal-organic frameworks; and (iii) synthesis, characterization, and gas adsorption applications of covalent organic frameworks.

AB Green chemistry emerged over the past several decades as an important component of chemical education. Many different types of educational materials have been created to teach students the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry. However, an international push towards sustainable development challenged green chemistry educators to teach students to weigh the complex factors of green chemistry and consider societal factors of sustainability. In this paper, we review courses and programs that strive to achieve these goals and assessment methods that have been used to evaluate student outcomes of green chemistry courses.

AB This paper addresses the use of student-generated instructional videos to promote awareness of green chemistry principles during remote instruction. For this activity, we used Flipgrid as an asynchronous platform for students to create their videos based on assigned case studies from the Green Chemistry Challenge award winners. The Flipgrid platform was used to engage students in scientific discourse with their peers. The activity was viewed favorably by students with most indicating that they would like to see similar assignments implemented in future courses. This project increased student awareness of the 12 green chemistry principles. While this project was used in an Organic Chemistry II laboratory course with chemistry majors, it is our hope that other instructors who find the need to move their instruction online can use this activity either directly or with modifications to fit their course needs.

AB IOData is a free and open-source Python library for parsing, storing, and converting various file formats commonly used by quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics, and plane-wave density-functional-theory software programs. In addition, IOData supports a flexible framework for generating input files for various software packages. While designed and released for stand-alone use, its original purpose was to facilitate the interoperability of various modules in the HORTON and ChemTools software packages with external (third-party) molecular quantum chemistry and solid-state density-functional-theory packages. IOData is designed to be easy to use, maintain, and extend; this is why we wrote IOData in Python and adopted many principles of modern software development, including comprehensive documentation, extensive testing, continuous integration/delivery protocols, and package management. This article is the official release note of the IOData library.

AB Nowadays, the environment protection and the personal health and safety are given more consideration in the field of chemistry, thus resulting in an increased number of published researches about how to work according to green instructions, to follow up the recommendations of environmental agencies and to obtain better clean handling of chemistry. In this review, green chemistry definition, importance, principles, and some recent applications in the field of green chemistry were discussed. In addition, the review summarizes the evolution of green analytical chemistry (GAC) with its specific principles and how to make the analytical process more environmentally benign with special emphasis on recent applications of GAC. Moreover, the green chromatography, its methods, and some of its applications were outlined. Finally, different techniques available up till now for the assessment of greening of the methods were also presented.

AB The purpose of this study was to describe pre-service chemistry teachers' environmental value orientation and creative thinking skill, as well as profile of creative attitude after implementing Green Chemistry Laboratory Learning. This study was conducted after development of student worksheet oriented Green Chemistry approach for General Chemistry course of pre-service chemistry teachers. The implementation of such learning into the classroom used one group pretest posttest research design. The data gathered were analyzed descriptively. Research data obtained showed positive change of egocentric, homocentric, and ecocentric orientation with respectively an average gain score was 0.24 (low gain), 0.13 (low gain), and 0.15 (low gain). An increase of creative thinking skill was showed by an average gain score of 0.67 (medium gain). The profile of creative attitude of pre-service chemistry teachers showed that for curiosity aspect obtained average score of 3.18 (creative), the mean score of a flexible thinker was 3.17 (creative), and the highest average score was reached by an intrinsically motivated student, that is 3.48 (very creative). Based on the data analysis and discussion, it can be concluded that the implementation of Green Chemistry Laboratory Learning had promoted the change of pre-service chemistry teachers' environmental value orientation and the increase of creative thinking skill, in addition to support their creative attitude during the learning process.

AB Chemistry is a school subject that is not viewed favorably among pupils. Before we can improve pupils' attitudes toward chemistry, it is important to find out the problem as to why the attitudes are relatively negative. The research was focused on Czech lower secondary and secondary grammar school pupils' attitudes to the subject of chemistry. Also, the difference between groups of variables (gender and grade) was examined. The sample size contained 931 Czech lower secondary and secondary grammar school pupils. The research tool was a questionnaire with 25 Likert type items. By the use of factor analysis, the items were distributed into four categories: 1) Popularity and difficulty of chemistry, 2) The relevance of chemistry, 3) Chemical aids and laboratory experiments, 4) The future life and chemistry. The overall score indicated neutral/slightly positive pupils' attitude toward chemistry. Girls received a lower score in comparison with boys in all grades, except the 1st grade, in secondary grammar schools. The opposite situation was among lower secondary school pupils, where girls achieved a slightly higher attitude score. It is possible to say that negative attitudes toward chemistry are also among lower secondary and secondary grammar school pupils, so it is needed to try to improve attitudes toward chemistry from the early age of pupils. The recommendations for the pedagogical practice are suggested in the conclusion.

AB The current research on systems thinking criticizes the additive nature of green chemistry (GC) not being supportive of systems thinking to achieve holism in its practices. This paper argues that systems thinking should comprise of the social issues, and, therefore, it studies renowned papers by GC pioneers and reviews on the field regarding how they address the social dimension of sustainability. It points out how GC has ignored social sustainability in its discourses, practices, and evaluations, leading to a reductionist interpretation of sustainability. Then, this paper presents some challenges to be overcome in order to achieve balanced sustainability. A systemic chemical thinking is advocated, considering chemistry in culture and chemistry as culture, expanding the chemistry rationality from ontological and technological dimensions into the epistemological and ethical ones. It is then discussed how chemistry education can help to promote sustainability in a broad and systemic way.

AB Green Analytical Chemistry (GAC) is a research field that seeks for more sustainable analytical approaches to minimize the toxicity and amounts of wastes without hindering the analytical performance. This is a trend in Analytical Chemistry worldwide and because of the diversity of innovations on this subject, Brazil stands out as the third in the list of the main contributors to GAC, with ca. 11.2% of the published articles. Significant innovations and interesting applications in several fields have been presented and Brazil is continuously moving from Chemistry to Green Chemistry also in the Analytical Chemistry field. Selected contributions for sample preparation, spectro- and electroanalysis, separation techniques, chemometrics, and also procedures for point-of-care measurements are critically reviewed.

AB Twenty-seven first-year nursing students, divided across six focus groups formed on the basis of their past chemistry experience, were interviewed about their chemistry experience as a component of a Health Science unit. Information related to learning and academic performance was able to be established from student conversations resulting in three themes (and associated categories): Connectivity (curriculum, application, and social interaction); Reductivity (nature of chemistry, exposition, and control of learning); and Reflexivity (confidence, anxiety, and goal orientation). The framework proved useful in portraying relationships between themes for conversations related to tutorial sessions, prior knowledge, and chemistry in nursing. The focus groups were representative of the total cohort of students in terms of gender, age, working hours, academic performance, enjoyment level of chemistry, and the extent of the relevance of chemistry to nursing. Implications for chemistry educators, especially those supporting novices, are considered.

AB Muon spectroscopy offers a uniquely sensitive method for exploring many mechanisms in chemistry and chemical physics through the study of muonium, a probe species formed during muon implantation that is chemically equivalent to hydrogen. Next generation experiments in the field of muonium chemistry will require reliable liquid handling systems, in-situ experimental capabilities and access to advanced methods such as Radio-Frequency (RF) muon spin resonance spectroscopy. This paper discusses the development and commissioning of systems for sample handling, describing details of two liquid panels suitable for deoxygenation and transfer of liquid samples, the development of a centre stick for an existing 4 He flow cryostat suitable for RF muon chemistry experiments, a dedicated muon chemistry insert specifically optimized for RF liquid phase chemistry experiments, and a birdcage RF cavity optimized for high frequency measurements and with a geometry well-suited for beamline experiments that exploit the chemistry insert. Example data is presented, demonstrating the application of these various pieces of equipment.

AB This chapter provides the basic concepts for the characterisation of quantum chemistry as a research programme. I start with the characterisation of a quantum mechanics, and then gradually add the components that turn a generic quantum mechanics into quantum chemistry. This approach allows two specific philosophical outcomes: it allows us to make explicit what type of further characterisations are necessary to turn quantum mechanics into quantum chemistry and it allows us to specify in sufficient detail what the structure of quantum chemistry qua explanatory theory is.

Although biological systems contain a plethora of biomolecules that can deactivate inorganic species, researchers have shown that small-molecule metal catalysts could be engineered to operate in heterogeneous aqueous environments. Synthetic intracellular reactions have recently been reported for olefin hydrogenation, hydrolysis/oxidative cleavage, azide-alkyne cycloaddition, allylcarbamate cleavage, C-C bond cross coupling, and transfer hydrogenation. Other promising targets for new biocompatible reaction discovery will also be discussed, with a special emphasis on how such innovations could lead to the development of novel technologies and chemical tools.

AB The purpose of this article is not to delineate the steps to move across the continuum to being a greener chemist, but to analyse the cognitive processes involved in fostering a green chemistry growth mindset (GCGM) [Dweck C. (2006) Mindset: The New Psychology of Success. New York, NY: Ballatine]. The focus is on changing the mindset, which inevitably will lead to a more mindful approach to chemistry practices before the laboratory begins. A green chemistry fixed mindset (GCFM) is closed to making improvements, since the attitude is that the techniques and processes in the laboratory are already employing a green chemistry mindset [Dweck C. (2006) Mindset: The New Psychology of Success. New York, NY: Ballatine]. The problem with the GCFM is that it precludes the possibility of making improvements. However, the GCGM employs a continuous, intentional focus on the attitude towards green chemistry, with the ultimate goal being a change in chemistry practices that is greener. The focus of this article will be on the GCGM.

AB Results from an employer survey that examines the skills gap, that exists for students majoring in chemistry are presented. Employers expect candidates with technical abilities but desire those who possess strong interprofessional skills. Although employers do not expect students to have had explicit teaching and application of interprofessional skills, employers wish that chemistry programs incorporated them. The results show which particular skills, specific to chemists and in relation to other fields, make up the skills gap and are in demand. Employers of chemistry majors utilize grade-point average as an initial metric to rank candidates, much like other STEM and non-STEM employers, but unlike most other fields, they choose candidates who have had team experiences specifically related to chemistry topics. The discussion illustrates how and when chemistry candidates can best highlight their acquired skill sets. These results will be of interest to those who develop Chemistry students. and implement chemistry curricula and to B.S.

AB With the rapid development of computer technology and the gradual improvement of virtual experiment theory, virtual chemistry experimental system has gradually moved from theory to application stage and has been active in teaching activities in middle schools. However, due to its limitations and some of its functions need to be further improved, it can't meet the needs of teachers and students and the majority of research workers to study and research. Based on the deficiency of virtual chemistry experiment system, how to develop virtual chemistry experiment system adapting to current teaching and research was studied. In this paper, the solid modeling technology and virtual chemistry experiment system algorithm of 3D virtual chemistry experiment system based on OpenGL were studied. The design ideas and key techniques of the virtual chemistry experiment system were discussed in detail. Finally, the dynamic simulation of the experimental phenomena was realized, which accumulated a wealth of knowledge for developers of virtual chemistry experiment systems.

AB There are several consequences of the negative or poor perception that society tends to maintain with Chemistry like the lack of interest of students in considering Chemistry as a career or the university dropout rates. Given the importance of museums and science centers to contribute to scientific education and arouse people's interest in science, this article presents a research carried out with Brazilian science centers and museums to appraise the space of Chemistry in non-formal places of Education. The results obtained are similar to some international data showing the amount of chemistry-related content in museums is insufficient, not exceeding the 40% rate. Most of the activities are aimed at supporting formal education by offering courses for teachers and students through the use of laboratories or conducting experiments when there is available monitoring. Chemistry can be considered in the development of science museums exhibitions and, with the guidance of scientists, it can be shown and discussed without creating distorted visions, sensationalism or conceptual misconceptions.

AB Translation abstract One of the characteristics of chemistry as a science is, amongst others, thinking in models. Their use must therefore be an essential part of teaching chemistry at secondary level SII. Sparked by the controversial discussion on the question, whether teaching quantum chemistry in grammar school is adequate, teaching units on the topics of "quantum chemistry and chemical bonding", "quantum chemistry and organic coloured substances" as well as "quantum chemistry and pigments" were developed at the ETH Zurich and the University of Bern over many years. A broad-based field study confirmed the good quality of these teaching units, which have proven their worth many times over in Switzerland and Germany. The revised texts are available in the form of four modules that can be combined with each other, two lead programs as well as Power Point presentations and additional exercises with solutions. Since 2010, the materials have been available to a larger number of users free of charge on the Internet as part of an e-dossier from the Institute for Continuing Education (PHBern). After a short introduction, this article outlines the importance of quantum chemistry for the SII and introduces the individual modules/guidance programs/accompanying materials.

AB The Ministry of Research-Technology and Higher Education of Indonesia has established competency standards and Learning Outcomes (LO) for chemistry teacher candidates. The fact is that until now chemical education in school is still far from expectations. One of the subjects in the department of chemistry education which has a responsible for the fulfillment of competence is food chemistry. Food chemistry is one of the elective courses provided to prospective chemistry teachers in most of Teacher Education Institutions (TEI). Descriptive study has been conducted to picture the implementation of the food chemistry lectures from the perspective of the curriculum, the learning process, and the students' views. The subject involved were, secondary data (curriculum) from six (6) TEIs, students, and classroom activity. The data were interpreted by triangulation to make a conclusion. The results showed that lectures have not fully accommodated the LO according to competency standards expectations. The lectures have accommodated the fulfillment of conceptual achievement, but still lacks the building of high-level skills of such as problem-solving skills and evaluative thinking skills. The recommendation of this research is the need to reorient the curriculum of food chemistry course and its implementation in the lecture.

AB The Croatian Chemical Society was established in 1926 and has developed over the decades into a society that actively supports all chemical activities in Croatia. The Society has eight divisions, the youngest of which, the Division of Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, was established in 2012 and immediately became a member of the European Federation of Medicinal Chemistry (EFMC). The mission of the Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry Division is the promotion and development of scientific, professional, and educational activities within the medicinal chemistry community in Croatia, as well as to build partnerships and collaborations with other primarily EU-based medicinal chemistry societies. In Croatia, medicinal chemistry research is ongoing at several institutes, including the University of Zagreb (Faculty of Science, Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, and Faculty of Chemical Engineering and Technology), national institutes of science (Ruder Bokovi Institute), and private-sector drug discovery companies (CRO Fidelta Ltd.). In order to effectively exchange knowledge, ideas, and scientific results, Croatian medicinal chemists meet twice annually.

AB Description: The action research evaluation describes a variety of novel teaching and learning techniques that were incorporated into a medicinal chemistry course. Clinically relevant medicinal chemistry cases were presented to learners complemented with 3D protein visualisation software in lectures. Evaluation: The learning outcome of students was assessed using in-class quizzes, poster session presentations and exams. Students' marks and post-course surveys were used to assess the newly employed teaching methods. The improvement in student marks complemented the post-course surveys resulted. The majority of students agreed that the course design has improved their understanding of medicinal chemistry in general and helped in relating the course to pharmacy practice. Conclusion: This study suggests that diversifying teaching and learning methods is essential to improved students' performance and understanding of medicinal chemistry. The integration of clinically relevant medicinal chemistry cases may help students to relate the concepts of drug chemistry, and drug design aspects to pharmacy practice.

DE Bundled dynamic adaptive chemistry; Semi-implicit scheme; Auto-ignition
   combusiton chemistry
AB A bundled dynamic adaptive chemistry (BDAC) method is proposed to accelerate the combustion chemistry integration. Based on the basic dynamic adaptive chemistry (DAC) method (which dynamically reduces the chemical mechanism in the simulation within every time step in combustion simulations), this BDAC method bundles the similar conditions and applies DAC on the bundled computational domain both spatially and temporally. In this way, the cost of the chemistry reduction process could be greatly saved. This method was coupled with a semi-implicit integration scheme and a conventional implicit solver and then tested in methane/air auto-ignition. The performance of BDAC in terms of accuracy and efficiency is subsequently compared with the original solver and the DAC method. It is shown that this method is able to dramatically reduce the computational cost, while still maintain acceptable accuracy. This method is very promising to be employed in multidimensional CFD simulations to reduce computational cost. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this chapter, the essential feature of realistic combustion chemistry is first introduced. Manifestations of nonlinear detailed chemistry in homogeneous combustion systems as well as convective-diffusive systems are demonstrated, with useful insights on turbulent combustion and guidance for the adoption of detailed chemistry in combustion modeling. Recent progress on premixed and non-premixed counterflow cool flamelets is systematically discussed, shedding light on the local behavior of detailed chemistry in turbulent reacting flows. In addition, an overview covering model reduction, stiffness removal, and other computational methods to facilitate chemistry integration is provided to show the feasibility to accommodate realistic chemistry in laminar and turbulent combustion modeling. Last but not the least, typical methods of computational diagnostics are reviewed to show the necessity and capability of probing and understanding combustion modeling results in general.

AB The chemical sciences integrate numerous pieces of structural data into families of compounds, and countless experimental results of reactive processes into ground rules. Collecting these pieces of information, analyzing them, and making the relevant contextual connections between them is in the heart of chemistry education. Here we emphasize the contribution of technology, and more specifically, chemical databases for enhancing these learning processes. Several important, open access, databases are described in detail and examples of using them in chemistry class are provided. In an era of continuous information revolution we hope that chemistry instructors will take the next step up, and acquire the professional skills needed to integrate the use of technology and chemistry databases in their classes.

AB The establishment of bioorthogonal chemistry is one of the most significant advances in chemical biology using exogenous chemistry to perturb and study biological processes. Photo-modulation of biological systems has realized temporal and spatial control on biomacromolecules in living systems. The combination of photo-modulation and bioorthogonal chemistry is therefore emerging as a new direction to develop new chemical biological tools with spatiotemporal resolution. This minireview will focus on recent development of bioorthogonal chemistry subject to spatiotemporal control through photo-irradiation. Different strategies to realize photo-control on bioorthogonal bond-forming reactions and biological applications of photo-controllable bioorthogonal reactions will be summarized to give a perspective on how the innovations on photo-chemistry can contribute to the development of optochemical biology. Future trends to develop more optochemical tools based on novel photochemistry will also be discussed to envision the development of chemistry-oriented optochemical biology.

AB Development of synthetic systems carrying life-like features is a long-standing challenge in chemistry and material science. Poor understanding of mechanisms ruling the emergence of life-like features in an inanimate matter makes the challenge even more exciting. The growing field of systems chemistry takes the lead in defining life-like dynamic signatures in minimalistic (macro)molecular systems through the development of multicomponent synthetic models using tools from organic and supramolecular chemistry. Recent progress in nanoscience makes available a range of novel materials that can undoubtedly enrich systems chemistry. Therefore, with the aim of placing nano- and colloidal science within the context of systems chemistry, the recent experimental and theoretical developments dealing with the use of nanoparticles and their assemblies in the realisation of the concepts such as replication, reproduction and selection are discussed.

AB The Hungarian-born American chemistry Nobel laureate George A. Olah used superacids to give longer life to carbocations. He resolved a long-standing debate on reaction mechanism in organic chemistry and, more importantly, opened new vistas in hydrocarbon chemistry to produce hosts of new compounds. The concerted utilization of organic synthesis, physical techniques, and computational methods led to spectacular achievements in hydrocarbon chemistry. Olah has always been on the lookout for the practical applications of his discoveries in fundamental chemistry. He continued his research after his Nobel award and has worked out the idea, which he labeled "the methanol economy." Olah's example shows that a great researcher can also be a devoted and caring human being.

AB This laboratory experiment visually demonstrates the advanced scientific concept of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) using hands-on learning methods. The experiment is divided into two parts: the first period consists of synthesis and isolation of the organic compound 2(TPA-O)-TPE using typical organic chemistry lab techniques; the second period focuses on visual demonstration of AIE properties based on micelle formation and thin-layer chromatography (TLC). By introducing a scientific concept through a classic technology, students can build on the foundation of prior understandings and experiences toward engaging new ideas. This experiment is suitable for many areas of chemistry, especially for organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, and materials chemistry.

AB The interface of art and science provides a broad range of educational and collaborative projects at various learning stages. Therefore, the use of historic artists' materials for teaching chemistry is receiving more attention. We prepared and used copper acetate (verdigris pigment) for a series of interconnected, lab-based activities, which can be applied to high-school-level chemistry, to undergraduate general chemistry, and further to heritage conservation science research for emerging art conservators. The synthesis and degradation processes of artists' materials like this pigment allow instructors to illustrate scientific concepts like redox chemistry, while extending the vision of science to arenas beyond the classroom.

AB The authors were inspired to explore the topic of gender diversity in computational chemistry on the basis of similar recent publications in the related fields of medicinal chemistry (Huryn, D. M.; et al. ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2017, 8, 900) and computational biology (Bonham, K S.; Stefan, M. I. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2017, 13, e1005134). To do so, we examined historical demographics in two different professional settings, i.e., attendance/participation at the Gordon Research Conferences on Computer-Aided Drug Design and Computational Chemistry and membership in the Computers in Chemistry Division of the American Chemical Society. We conclude that female representation in computational chemistry has risen steadily over the last 40 years and likely stands at around 25%, which appears to slightly exceed that of the neighboring fields of computer science and medicinal chemistry. In accordance with the old slogan that "a rising tide lifts all boats", here a rising tide of women scientists is having an impact on the field of computational chemistry. Tactics to ensure that this number continues to improve are highlighted.

AB To succeed in physical chemistry courses, students need competence with a significant amount of mathematics, including ordinary and partial differential equations and linear operators. This can present a barrier to student success because many of these topics are not taught in the traditional prerequisite calculus sequence. Through a collaboration of the Departments of Chemistry and Mathematics, Colorado State University has developed and implemented a two-semester sequence of courses, Applied Mathematics for Chemists, aimed specifically at providing students with the mathematical tools necessary for success in physical chemistry. This report summarizes one of the invited papers to the ConfChem online conference on Mathematics in Undergraduate Chemistry Instruction, held from October 23 to November 27, 2017, and hosted by the ACS DivCHED Committee on Computers in Chemical Education (CCCE).

AB The main purpose of this paper is to present Slovenian and Finnish prospective chemistry teachers' perceptions of their future profession, especially with regard to their understanding of the role of the triple nature of chemical concepts (macro, submicro and symbolic) and their representations in chemistry learning. A total of 19 prospective teachers (10 Slovenian, 9 Finnish) at master's level in chemical education participated in the research. The prospective teachers' opinions were gathered using an electronic questionnaire comprising six open-ended questions. The study revealed many parallels between Slovenian and Finnish prospective chemistry teachers' perceptions of their future profession and their understanding of the role of the triple nature of chemical concepts, especially particle representations, in chemistry learning. The majority of the prospective teachers from both countries believe that personal characteristics are the most important attribute of a successful chemistry teacher. Thus, they highly value teachers' enthusiasm for teaching and the use of contemporary teaching approaches in chemistry. The prospective teachers displayed an adequate understanding of the role of the triple nature of chemical concepts (i.e., particle representations) in the planning and implementation of a specific chemistry lesson.

AB In this study 635 general chemistry I and general chemistry II students completed a 40-item Likert-scale survey on their opinions of various practices, including some academically dishonest practices, that might occur in the general chemistry laboratory. The practices surveyed were focused on areas including preparation before coming to the laboratory, getting help with the pre-lab assignments, various decisions made by the teaching assistant or laboratory instructor, getting help with the calculations and questions required by the laboratory report, and various methods of obtaining data in the laboratory. An exploratory factor analysis of the results was conducted to identify the underlying factors in the survey, and the scores of the general chemistry I and general chemistry II students along these factors were compared. The findings were generally consistent with results in the literature, but also provided implications for students' enculturation into chemistry and science as they progressed through their general chemistry coursework.

AB This laboratory experiment leverages the pedagogical value and multidisciplinary nature of biodiesel production from vegetable oil to introduce students to continuous-flow chemistry, a modern and rapidly growing approach to chemical synthesis. An interdisciplinary approach exposes students to the practical and conceptual aspects of modern continuous-flow chemistry while simultaneously reinforcing core organic chemistry techniques and investing students in issues of sustainability. Students screen reaction conditions in flow through an inquiry-guided approach and make evidence-based decisions to accomplish the sustainable conversion of waste cooking oil into biofuel. The laboratory experiment is designed to be highly modular and can be completed in two, three, five, or eight laboratory periods. By incorporating the burgeoning field of continuous-flow chemistry into the educational infrastructure, the experiments allow students to develop skills that are highly valued in the modem chemical workforce.

AB We analyzed the representations of acid-base models in 4 kinds of Chemistry I and 4 kinds of Chemistry II textbooks of the 2009 revised curriculum, and 9 kinds of Chemistry I textbooks and 6 kinds of chemistry II textbooks of the 2015 revised curriculum in this study. The problems of the textbook were divided into the problems of definitions and the representations of the logical thinking. As a result of the study, the lack of the concept of chemical equilibrium had a problem with the representation of reversible reactions in the definition of the Bronsted-Lowry model in the Chemistry I textbooks of 2009 revised curriculum, it also appeared to persist in Chemistry I textbooks of 2015 revised curriculum which contains the concept of chemical equilibrium. The representations of logical thinking were related to particle kinds of conservation logic, combinational logic, particle number conservation logic, and proportion logic. There were few problems related to representation of logical thinking in Chemistry I textbook in 2009 revision curriculum, but more problems of representations related to logics are presented in Chemistry I textbooks in 2015 revision curriculum. Therefore, as the curriculum is revised, the representations of chemistry textbooks related to acid and base models need to be changed in a way that can help students' understanding.

AB Visualizing molecular conformations and complex compound structures and chemical transformations in 3D is one of the most difficult tasks for undergraduate chemistry students. Modern computational technologies have revolutionized every aspect of our lives, including education. As a result, many researchers and educators are working on enhancing student learning and improving construction of knowledge by employing technologies that better illustrate theoretical concepts, such as the visualization of molecular geometry in chemistry. Here, to aid students in understanding molecular structures and chemical reaction mechanisms at the molecular level, we initially developed several 3D animations of fundamental chemical transformations aimed at organic chemistry courses for second- and third-year undergraduate level. These animations became the basis for the 3D augmented reality tool called ARchemy. A comprehensive survey was conducted to gather student feedback on the effectiveness of these tools and their perception of the subject matter using these technologies, which will be presented in this project.

AB The growing process of industrialization was a milestone for world economic evolution. Since the 1940s, social movements have revolutionized green chemistry and provided shifts in industrial positions and sustainable processes with advances in environmental impact and awareness of companies and population. Paul Anastas and John Warner, in the 1990s, postulated the 12 principles of Green Chemistry, which are based on the minimization or non-use of toxic solvents in chemical processes and analyzes, as well as, the non-generation of residues from these processes. One of the most active areas of Research and Development in Green Chemistry is the development of analytical methodologies, giving rise to the so-called Green Analytical Chemistry. The impacts of green chemistry on pharmaceutical analyzes, environmental, population, analyst and company are described in this review and they are multidimensional. Every choice and analytical attitude has consequences both in the final product and in everything that surrounds it. The future of green chemistry as well as our future and the environment is also contemplated in this work. (C) 2018 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

AB With new K-12 national science standards emerging, there is an increased need for experiments that integrate engineering into the context of society. Here we describe a chemistry experiment that combines science and engineering principles while introducing basic polymer and green chemistry concepts. Using medical sutures as a platform for investigating polymers, students explore the physical and mechanical properties of threads drawn from poly(epsilon-caprolactone) samples of different molecular masses and actual purchased absorbable and nonabsorbable medical sutures. An inquiry-based part of the experiment tasks students with designing their own experiment to probe the potential of melt blending poly(epsilon-caprolactone) with commercially available polylactide products in order to modify the properties of the "sutures" drawn. Through these lessons students gain an appreciation for the importance of plastics in our society and how scientists are working to develop more sustainable alternatives. Overall, this laboratory experiment provides a feasible, versatile, sophisticated laboratory experience that engages students in a relatable topic and meets many of the Next Generation Science Standards.

AB An interdisciplinary course called "The Chemistry of Poisons" was created, featuring organic chemistry, biology, pharmacology, and toxicology content. This exploratory chemistry elective course was created by an instructor with a background in synthetic organic chemistry and a teaching assistant with a background in pharmacy practice. "The Chemistry of Poisons" features an interdisciplinary, student-centered approach to learning that provides a foundation for future academic initiatives to deliver chemical, pharmacological, and humanistic content in a manner that is both enjoyable for students and demonstrably facilitates knowledge and application level learning. Student course feedback and a retrospective survey were used to gauge student-perceived learning achievement. Survey results and feedback were consistent with knowledge and application level learning of course content and preference for interdisciplinary course design. These results warrant further development and study of interdisciplinary strategies for chemical education.

DE Chemistry Teaching; epistemological obstacles; TV Series
AB In this paper we analyze and identify the potential TV series for chemistry teaching, highlighting some obstacles and possibilities. For this, a survey was conducted of the series that have genre about science/chemistry and science fiction/chemistry, presenting the epistemological obstacles and the multi, pluri and interdisciplinary character present in some episodes. The results indicate that the obstacle first experience is the most evident in series. In addition, most episodes analyzed presents multidisciplinary character, by encompass issues that can be worked in the disciplines of chemistry and biology. It was established that the TV series presents a new form of possibility to contextualize the classes, since they are part of students' daily lives.

TI Eponyms in clinical chemistry
SO CLINICA CHIMICA ACTA
LA English
DT Article
DE Eponyms; Clinical chemistry; Southern blot; Sanger sequencing; Biopython
AB Background: Eponyms are commonly used in medicine, but there are no specific studies of the use of eponyms in clinical chemistry.
   Methods: Clinical chemistry eponyms were manually collected from books, review articles and journal articles from 1847 through 2020. Eponym usage was examined by searching titles and abstracts in PubMed. Custom Python scripts were used to first permute eponyms into multiple forms, and then to search PubMed using Biopython. The eponyms identified in PubMed were further focused on 2 clinical chemistry journals Clinica Chimica Acta [CCA] and Clinical Chemistry [CCJ].
   Results: The manual collection identified >300 eponyms in clinical chemistry. The Biopython search of PubMed identified a subset of 97 unique eponyms in 33,232 articles. PubMed identified 26 eponyms used in 130 CCA articles; whereas a full-text search identified 1187 articles. In comparison, PubMed identified 36 eponyms used in 158 CCJ articles; whereas a full-text CCJ search identified 708 articles. PubMed shows that the journals CCA and CCJ had a peak number of eponym citations in 1977 followed by a steady decline.
   Conclusions: Eponyms have been frequently used in clinical chemistry with 97 eponyms in common use in PubMed. Overall, the use of clinical chemistry eponyms appears to be declining.

AB Membrane technology has been broadly utilized in water purification including wastewater treatment, seawater or brackish water desalination. However, it often suffers from the severe membrane fouling due to the nonspecific interactions between membrane surface and foulants. Antifouling membrane surface construction thus becomes an everlasting and ubiquitous issue, where chemistry plays a critical role in membrane material design, hierarchical structure manipulation, antifouling mechanism integration and separation performance intensification. Many emerging chemistries enable the rational design and construction of state-of-the-art antifouling membrane surfaces. This review will highlight the recent progress in antifouling membrane surface construction with a focus on five promising classes of chemistries: bioinspired adhesion chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, mineralization chemistry, click chemistry and coupling chemistry. The contribution of chemistries to the physico-chemical structure, antifouling properties, separation performance and long-term durability of membranes will be elaborated. Major challenges and perspectives on future directions of chemistries in antifouling membrane surface construction will also be tentatively delineated.

ID BIOSENSORS; CHEMISTRY
AB The MicRoboCop project introduces chemistry students to the concepts and protocols of synthetic biology. MicRoboCop is a biosensor that has been designed for unique applications in forensic chemistry. The lab is carried out in collaboration with an instructor teaching a genetics course. Students in the biology course synthesize biosensors using Escherichia coli (E. coli), and students in the chemistry course evaluate the effectiveness of the biosensors using analytical chemistry methods. Chemistry students learn basic microbiological techniques to culture the bacteria, and they analyze the expression of red fluorescent protein (RFP) using fluorescence spectroscopy. Students in upper-division (third- and fourth year) chemistry courses evaluated one part of the MicRoboCop system for its response to arsenic(III) and antimony(III) ions using fluorescence spectroscopy. The limits of detection for the biosensor were estimated using a spectrofluorimeter fitted with a 96-well plate reader, and were found to be less than 1 ppb for antimony and arsenic. Additionally, the biosensor was shown to respond similarly to both antimony and arsenic. Several different variations on the analysis of RFP expressing biosensors are presented, as well as different instrumental options for fluorescence analysis.

AB In the face of an imminent shortage of chemists, politics and the chemical industry are demanding a focus on career orientation in chemistry classes. To learn more about a chemistry-related career orientation of students. 1113 pupils of grades 8 and 11 were surveyed about the current implementation of vocational orientation in schools and factors influencing their choice of a career especially related to chemistry. The image of chemistry, students' self-concept and their description of a prototype of a chemist were considered. The multiple linear regressions calculated for grades 8 and 11 show in particular image variables and the chemical self-concept as influencing factors in the choice of a career related to chemistry. At the end of the article, the Chem-Trucking project is presented as a possibility to strengthen career orientation in chemistry classes. Here, students are given the opportunity to carry out environmental analytical measurements with professional equipment on the basis of authentic problems.

AB The call for integrating systems thinking (ST) with chemistry education focuses on the growing role chemistry will play in meeting global challenges, such as those presented by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. In this essay, we address two questions: How might ST help chemistry education address these global challenges? How might we prepare teachers to teach ST in their classrooms? To address these questions, we define these global challenges in terms of coupled human-natural systems, and we suggest a new way to integrate "the human element" into ST in chemistry education; namely, via the responsible research and innovation framework. We then demonstrate how this framework could be used productively to guide the professional development of chemistry teachers.
